I'm not going to lie, my roommate and I are pretty hungry tonight. We've been living off of ramen for a few weeks, and I honestly can't stomach any more. I'll be picking up my first paycheck in two months on Friday, and that in itself is a wonderful feeling. For now, I can hear my stomach yelling "pizza". I'm hoping someone could help us with a good meal tonight. We're both out of money, and I can provide proof of my overdrawn account if requested. Thank you all for reading.
