Basically I am a university student and I was hit by an unexpected utility bill and a requirement to pay a retainer on the property that I am moving in to next year for over the summer...these two things have cleaned me out! I am flying out to America with an organisation that places us in summer camps on the 16th but until then I have only 49 pence in my account! If any kind redditor can assist, let me know...
