Not gonna lie, I could go and buy a pizza for myself and my kids (wife's out of town on business for the next couple of weeks) but I just found this and it's a pretty cool idea so I figured I'd give it a shot!

Garlic Jim's is a little on the pricy-er side, we usually get Papa Murphy's Take'n'Bake, but can't beat the garlicky goodness that is Jim's!

Thanks Reddit!
