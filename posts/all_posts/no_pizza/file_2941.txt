I'm embarrassed to ask because I'm always a giver, but I would love to receive a large meat lovers deep dish pizza from Cottage Inn with mushrooms and onions on the whole thing and jalapeno on half. 

My boyfriend and I have been craving pizza the entire week, and he's coming over tonight but I can't afford to buy one. I don't have any meal plans left for the semester (ends Monday the 19th), and I can basically only feed him a sandwich or Cheerios. It would be awesome if someone could help out. I just spent all of my money on my monthly bills and books for next semester. Please and thank you!

EDIT: I can verify that I'm human or whatever. I will also try to do a random act of kindness for someone this weekend.
