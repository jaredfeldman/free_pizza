Hey my name is Andrew. Currently i'm unemployed and stream video games via twitch.tv full time to try and make some money here and there. I live in the Denver, Colorado area roughly.

I live at home with my mom after a few heavy life incidents led me to leave my job and move back home.

Streaming hasn't been making me much lately and i've been pretty broke, had to quit smoking cold turkey and can't exactly afford food at the moment either.

The last few days i've been really achy and sick and my mom didn't get child support for whatever  reason so we are scraping by until we get food stamps in a few days.

I've been looking for a job and working on getting my GED to help out on that front but no luck so far seeing as how I can't commute downtown every day.

If anyone would be cool and get me a pizza or something, that would be pretty legit.

Not really sure what else to put here, so sorry if anyone is looking for more info i'd be happy to edit my post for whatever reason.


Edit: I saw a contest for some bad MS paint art, i like to draw champions from League of Legends in paint for people who donate to my stream, so i'd be happy to draw one or more for someone who donates a pizza. (Doesn't have to be league related, but i'm terrible.)
