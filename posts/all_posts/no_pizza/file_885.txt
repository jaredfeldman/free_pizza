EDIT: Disregard, girl invited me to BBQ.  See you in a month, I'll still send out the pizzas.

All alone on fathers day sucks more than I thought it would.  I don't need much, just a small cheese from someone who cares to cheer me up.  I don't have enough $ for pizza and the gas I'll need to work my shitty job.  

I've never done this before but if I get something I'll send out two pizzas next month in your honor.
