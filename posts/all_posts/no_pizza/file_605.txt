Things have been hard. My wife and I worked for the same company and both got laid off about a month ago. Our unemployment still hasn't been approved and today we had to pawn our TV, game system and guitars so that we could pay bills. After putting gas in the car we don't even have enough left for some food. A pizza or two would help lift our spirits.
