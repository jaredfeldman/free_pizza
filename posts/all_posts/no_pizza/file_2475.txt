One of my PT jobs that allows me to keep teaching will involve stuffing hundreds of envelopes with my boss tonight. Pizza would be awesome, would restore my faith in...nah, I have faith in humanity. Just think it would keep our spirits up to have some tasty pizza :)

Will pay it forward (will anyway, whether we get any or not...love this sub :)
