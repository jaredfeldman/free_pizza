Wednesday: Moved out of my house, marriage in shambles.

Friday: In the ER with kidney stones. Intense amounts of pain.

Saturday: Missed my sister-in-law's wedding due to both previous events.

Monday: Reamed by my boss for shabby work, given this week to work on it.

Today: Oh crap it's Wednesday already. A long evening of work awaits.

If anyone wants to order me an [Austin's Pizza](http://www.austinspizza.com/menu.php) (the Redditor, of course) then it would add a little bright spot to my week. My friend, who's offering his couch rent-free, would appreciate the free grub as well. 

PM me if you're willing, no hard feelings if you're not.
