One of my classmates (Graduate of a high school in 2011) had a terrible motorcycle accident. He was in a coma for the first couple of days, then he came out but the doctors had to put him back into one (Self induced coma) in order to maintain his levels of stability for surgery. He is still in critical condition and I am hosting a benefit concert with my band for his family. They lost their mother when they were young (Elementary school) and Ethan (The boy who was hurt) has a twin brother. I've known them almost all of my life and am putting this concert together almost single handedly. 

I'm hoping to give pizza to the folks that are working at the concert and the bands playing.
If I get enough, I'll even sell it for just $1 a slice at the concert for extra benefit money for his family! 

Here is the link to the concert information for those of you wanting to just send your support.- https://www.facebook.com/events/164208037116711/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular

The pizza place (Shaker's) does not deliver so I will have to pick it up. You can order it for September the 28th from 1pm-6pm. You can possibly even preorder it! But if you do decide to order, order it under the name of "Steeple". That's how I'll pick it up. Thank you so much for those of you who send support and those who order! It means a lot. I've been so busy with this concert. 

The pizza place's number is (731)-663-2700.

EDIT: Also, please let me know if you order and for what time.
