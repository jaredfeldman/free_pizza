I make these in my free time and would love to share them with someone for a pie! I do not use graph paper anymore so there are no noticeable lines, and the best part is that I will literally send these anywhere!
I'll even do other characters from other NES games. (No customized ones though, I'm not that good.)
Thanks for your help!

*EDIT
Forgot to mention that these are cutouts. Hang them in your room if you want!
