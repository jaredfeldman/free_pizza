Hey guys! I am located in Dublin, Ireland and am so hungry! I haven't eaten anything for about 10 days because I am on exchange for school and have run out of money! Can't eat again until Dec. 16th when my mom gets paid and can send me some money! Would absolutely pay it forward once I have the funds to do so :)
