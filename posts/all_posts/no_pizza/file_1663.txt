Lost my job at an insurance company this past month due to lawsuits straining payroll but I was able to pay back my school (owed money for FAFSA overpayment) in order to enroll in the upcoming fall semester! 

Bad part is, I'm kinda tapped out while waiting for unemployment to kick in while I search for a job.
