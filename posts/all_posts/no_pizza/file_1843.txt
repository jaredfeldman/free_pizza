I am here because my 5 year old son has been sick off and on since just before Thanksgiving. He has had everything from strep throat (3x), ear infections (3x), sinus infection, pink eye, and the flu. He has now had vomiting and diarrhea and intermittent fevers since January. He has had several blood tests and labs done and we're hopefully getting the results back tomorrow. He has been tested from everything from food allergies and parasites to some pretty serious diseases. As of yesterday he has been feeling a bit better and is feeling up to eating something other than soup. I told him a while ago that once he was feeling better he could have whatever he wanted. Well, my little man has chosen pizza and unfortunately I just don't have the funds to do this right now. (only have a dollar and some change in the bank) So, I'm hoping someone can be my little boys pizza hero before he's not feeling up to eating.
