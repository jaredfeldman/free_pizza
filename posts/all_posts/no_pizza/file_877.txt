One of my good friends has recently been kicked out of his dad's house. He's 19, and has no where to go. I guess he's been staying in the parking lot of the store by my house, and he finally just mustered up the courage to ask for a warm bed for a few nights. My mom and I have such a bed, but we have very little funds. We've been living off free bagels and bananas for a while now. I can keep going off of that but I know my friend could really use something more special. I don't think he's actually eaten for a couple days. Anyways, I'm in Boise Idaho, and he'll be staying the night tonight. He's already really appreciative of the bed, but doesn't know I'm trying to do this. I'm working right now, but when I get my paycheck I'll be sure to pay it forward. If anyone can help out, it would mean the world to me, and him. Thanks for being an awesome subreddit.
