Life has been really tough for us over the past few months.  I finally finalized my divorce to my ex, who turned into an abusive alcoholic nightmare towards the end, and I couldn't be happier I'm away from him now.

I had a decent job as a nurse, but I was caught up in the downsizing at the hospital, and have been looking for a job for the past few months, without much luck.  

I haven't really been able to spoil my girls with anything in a long time, let alone a pizza, and I would be incredibly humbled and gracious if someone would be willing to help us out.

This is an amazing community, and I hope to be able to come back here soon on the other side, being able to give away some pizzas.

Thanks everyone
