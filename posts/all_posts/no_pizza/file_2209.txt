I'm in the middle of moving and have one more day before finals week starts. It's safe to say I'm going a little stir crazy. But mostly I would just really love a simple old pepperoni pizza. I've responded to a few offers and haven't had any responses. I PROMISE to pay it forward when I get moved in back home! Any one want to help a girl out? I would be forever in your debt! I cannot tell you how much it would mean to me.
