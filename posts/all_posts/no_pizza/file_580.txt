I'm 23 years old. My husband is 20. We live in Ohio right now and I DO work but it's barely paying the rent. We applied for food assistance just until we can get on our feet but they said it can take up to 30 days just for a decision. My husband can't work right now and I'm trying so desperately to find work on the side to feed us and pay for his immigration. See, me and my hubby met online in a Dragonball Z chatroom when we were young teenagers and we fell in love. He is Canadian and anyone out there who fell in love with someone in another country understands that it's an expensive process. We're both depressed. Me because I can't do more. And him because he can't work and support his family. We're making progress but slowly. We also have a 2 1/2 month old son. He is eating (and quite well if I were to be honest.. He's a little chow hound!) We've been living on Ramen Noodles and those cheap 99.9 percent water meats and bread. We don't even have ketchup or mustard anymore. The pepper is gone, the salt is almost there. Will take a picture of our fridge and cupboard if desired. We don't even have a tree and ZERO family in the area. I would probably start crying if someone actually helped.. I'm tearing up now lol.. Anyways that's our story. Would totally appreciate it and god bless you all anyways.
