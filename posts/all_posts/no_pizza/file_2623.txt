One of my close friends is in need of some guy time, his family moved back east and after his uncle committed suicide last week he's been a little torn up (he had to go to the funeral alone). I would like to give him some solid man grieving time. A friend gave me some beer from a party he threw last week but if someone could give me a coupon to Papa Johns I promise to do the same next month.

I'm running short this month due to some legal fees I had to pay and some of the extra money I make as a contractor won't get into my bank account till the end of the month. All in all this is just shitty timing.
