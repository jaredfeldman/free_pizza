I'm in summer school and I spent all my money on books and Webassign. ($200 just to access my homework...)  I have a minimum wage job that pays on a week delay and I won't see a nickel until June 11. [Here is all the food I have left.](http://imgur.com/7qK3D7o)

I would be sooooooo happy to have some pizza this evening.

Raleigh, NC

Edit: Do one of you know me? I just got an email for a free pizza from Papa Johns...
