Would very much appreciate a Pizza for Dexter night tonight! My friends and I usually have munchies, this time we are watching it at my house. Because I am trying to lose weight (20 pounds down!) I spent all of my food-money on healthy shit nobody will want. I would be more than happy to return the favour tomorrow or Tuesday.

Thanks for reading! On a side note: who's excited for Dexter?!
