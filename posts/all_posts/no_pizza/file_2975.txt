Sad girls seek pizza in Southeast Masachusetts!

My best friend is letting me stay at her house for a couple days due to a mild case of homelessness, and we have a lot of feelings. We want to watch Mean Girls and bond because she misses her boyfriend (a doctor stationed in OK), and we're really hungry, too! She has a dollar to her name, and my boss from my summer job owes me $1,500 - of which I've received nothing.

A little boost in the form of Domino's would be SO appreciated and I'll be sure to pass on the favor as soon as I can!

EDIT: I'm not a woman (well, girl?) of many talents, but if you want, I'll sing for you or draw a picture or write you a story. I can't promise they will be awesome, but I will try! Anything for my friend's happiness/ pizza. :)

Love,

Lemon &amp; Cleo
