Extremely hungry 23 year old in between jobs and out of stuff to pawn here (except my computer but lets be real, I'm not gonna pawn it lol), hoping to find a kind soul that would like to put pizza in my belly.
PM me for my address
I live in downtown Charleston, SC. You can choose between any of the big chains as well as a few stores. I'd prefer Papa Johns but its up to you
