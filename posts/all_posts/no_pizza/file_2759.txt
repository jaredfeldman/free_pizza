From March 30th to April 1st, all of my nearby family (nuclear and extended), will be having glorious fun times at the beach during Spring Break, but I CAN'T go because MY Spring Break was 2 weeks ago because I'm in college and they have to be all DIFFERENT and SPECIAL. When this happened last year, I ate nothing but cottage cheese from the back of the fridge seasoned with tears of loneliness(hyperbole for comedic affect) because I'm shit at cooking dinner(and lazy).

BUT...

What if there was a glorious community of internet Supermen, capable of setting me up with some sort of electronic code, equivalent to some amount of money, with which I could order GLORIOUS CIRCLES OF CHEESE AND BREAD, preferably from Papa Johns, and HAVE THEM DELIVERED TO MY DOOR BY WHITE STALLIONS THAT SHIT SPARKLES?

Anyone feeling generous? Sparkle-shitting stallions are optional, if that would help.
