First time asker, long time lurker. 
My roommate gets off work in a few hours and we plan to marathon s2 of game of thrones. Surprising him with pizza, and feeding myself of course, would be the best thing ever! We haven't been able to afford much food lately since he is now unable to sell plasma after a complication last time, so we're always a bit hungry. 

Thanks so much in advance!
