I hate banks, because of a glitch in the banks system my check n't be in til monday,"cross my fingers." the problem is that I have a wife and 3 kids who were counting on that check as well as myself. now, we are not only going to be late for rent, our electricity may get shut off as well as we are past due, we only have some ramen noodles and popcycles for dinner.we were counting on my check to get groceries, and as you can see, that is out of the picture. it doesn't help neither of us have fa,ily members here, so we can't even borrow. so if anyone out there can help, we would appriate it. I am not sure how this works, so I wil include my email as well, it is staglord01@yahoo.com. feel free to contact me, and my family would appreiate any help right now, it will be payed forward next week. thanx for listening.
