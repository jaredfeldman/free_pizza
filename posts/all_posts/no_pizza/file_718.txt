Things are a bit tight right now, but I'll be able to repay at the end of the month. Christmas pizza, yay =)

A bit about me, if it interests you- I'm currently a full time volunteer (like in the Peace Corps, but not called the Peace Corps) working at a small nonprofit in DC. I live in a big house with 12 other volunteers (I am NOT requesting pizza for 12 people, goodness xD) I just learned how to ride a bicycle last summer, and I play a bunch of instruments.

Thanks for looking =)
