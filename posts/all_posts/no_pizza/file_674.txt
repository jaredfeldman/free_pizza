So, last night I celebrated my 89th day sober. I would like to celebrate my 90th day this evening and since I am not drinking anymore, a pie would be awesome! Ramon isn't much of a celebratory food, no matter how you josh it up. My sponsor knows my financial situation and referred me to this site last night after the meeting. This is a huge day for me, as I have been drinking heavily for 8 years and it's been extremely hard to quit but I have and perhaps there's someone who'd like to celebrate with me. God bless and Stay strong.
