Hay reddit, about a year ago my mom got colon cancer and they had to do a big surgery to remove it. ( the took out about two feet of her colon) just this week she went back in only to find out that she had a 4x5x6 tumor on the right side of her brain. My dad's a trucker and until he can get back home (today hopeful) I've been left to fend for my self. I am craving a pizza but I have no money; could someone help me out with that?
