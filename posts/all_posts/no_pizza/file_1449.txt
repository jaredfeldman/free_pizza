Hey, lets just throw some info out here first, im 16 and dont live with my father and am going to meet my mother next month, and i currently have no money and no food and i have a MAAAAD craving for some pizza. 
So if someone would give me a random act of pizza before im homeless it would be much appreciated and i would give just as much back to the board when everything is stabilized again.
Thanks in advance, even if you dont. 

*Edit* Also, i live in Ontario Canada if that helps any.
