So this is what happened (long story short)! My girlfriend rang me yesterday and said we needed to sort things out, went to meet her and she blurted out how she hasn't been happy for a while and that i'm not the same guy I used to be - dunno how i'm gonna get through this one, I loved her to bits.

To top it all off I don't get paid till friday and even then It will be a tiny amount, I don't do many shifts because I suffer from depression, all money goes on living and its never enough - some pizza would really perk me up right now in this dark times.
