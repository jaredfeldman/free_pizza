Not into sob stories, but I AM into honesty and NOT being hungryas we all should be). Im unemployed at the moment. My roomie/best friend is out of town and has been for a week. Ive sustained off the groceries we had but the fridge is going bare. I've got really good friends coming over tonight and I want to show them I care. Help me out? I can eat the ramen noodles.. I jus dont want that to be what I offer my friends... u kno? Its appreciated!! &lt;3&lt;3
