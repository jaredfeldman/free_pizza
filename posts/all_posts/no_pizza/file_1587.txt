Hey guys, I'm new to this subreddit! Greetings, I'm Rin.

I've been applying for jobs since before summer started... I started a week before finals. This is the first job I've found this summer, though! And school starts back next month.

I'm nervous about the job, as it's a cold-calling and lead generation job.

And I could go for a pizza.

Feel free to say "no", RAOP. Or say nothing! Or just wish me good luck on my new job, for hopefully soon I can afford my own pizza! And IDEALLY, pizza for others, too!
