Back in late may, I ran into a pot hole with my bike. I hit the pavement face-first and lost some teeth/ broke my jaw. From june 6th to July 6th, I had my jaw tightly wired shut, and subsisted on smoothies, red lentils, and pudding. My jaw has been unwired, but I still have a bunch of dental bills to look forward to that I don't know if I can pay. Help me forget about the bills, and celebrate some pizza.
