Hey guys, long story short, myself, husband and son ran out of food stamps last week and all we've had in the house is rice, bread, peanut butter, a bit of ground beef, cheese, and some condiments. We will receive more stamps in the morning (5/17). Us adults are definitely feeling the appetite fatigue.

Myself, I'm starting a diet/fitness program tomorrow, so tonight is my last night to cheat, and I have a craving for Papa Johns spinach chicken Alfredo pizza

Anyone want to treat us to a pie or two?
