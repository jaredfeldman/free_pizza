Update: She woke up, I'm cooking dinner. Butter chicken &amp; rice. No pizza needed anymore. Thanks for the kind wishes all!

Came home from group to a girlfriend who has cried herself to sleep because her friends have bailed on plans with her again. Hell, one of them has bailed on treating her like a human being anymore in general.

I want to have a treat for her when she wakes, but we're running on empty money-wise. She loves pizza with chicken and bacon on it, but if that can't happen, I'll start cooking for her as soon as she wakes up - just don't want to make any noise right now and wake her up because she actually looks peaceful (although puffy-eyed from crying).
