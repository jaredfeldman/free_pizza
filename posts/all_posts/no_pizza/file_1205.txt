Fufilled. Thanks for reading.

Hi there. I'm a 22 year old male who has recently moved. Since moving, I've lost a friend, been mugged at gunpoint, had to replace an alternator, and now I have to replace the struts my car. In fact, it should have been finished a week ago but due to some reasons I'm unaware of it seems that the mechanic I hired has cancelled on me three times and wont even answer the phone at this point. He even has the parts that I paid for sitting on his property. I simply don't have the know how to do so, or I'd do it myself.

As far as losing a friend goes, someone had a change in plans regarding my living situation. I was to stay with her for a few weeks while I found another place. She told me to find a new place pretty much immediately and that I was acting like a child, ect. I wasn't even there half of the time, so I honestly do not know why she went so crazy. It kind of hurt to see her suddenly change like that, since we were friends for so long.

In any case, it's getting pretty rough here lately. I can't leave this end of town for any reason due to my car problems so grocery runs are limited, too. I'm lucky enough to work really close to where I live, so there is limited strain on the car in its [current state](http://i.imgur.com/Z5sdP.jpg). (The strut has recently fallen completely off.) I simply request a pizza. Thanks for reading. I appreciate anything you can offer.
