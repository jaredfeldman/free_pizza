My girlfriend and i got kicked out a little over a week ago from our apartment after we both lost our jobs working with the portland water bureau ...i have eaten a half of a sandwich at my friends house 2 days ago and got some free water at mcdonalds and stuff over the last few days... but in a week we have really eaten nothing and we are house sitting for a friend. He is offering to give us both $20 for a 3 day house sit,But he doesnt get paid till Saturday, and there is no food in this house, (2 pieces of stale bread that we ate) its our first night and we have no money. I was using my friends internet at his house looking for jobs and i cam upon an email from a friend who works with children with special needs, and he gave me the URL to this website. So i am hoping anyone who has a kind heart to feed an honest hard working man and girlfriend for a night or two would be willing to help us out with some pizza. Thanks in advances.
