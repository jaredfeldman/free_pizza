I moved to the UK from Virginia (DC Suburb) about 2 years ago and I worked at a Franchised owned Subway Restaurant and I was hospitalized while I was there. When I got out of the hospital, I found out that I no longer worked there. that was about 2 months ago. I have been struggling to find a job in the last 2 months and I just paid my rent and now I am now down to my last Â£7:

Any help to eat something other then cheap tinned food would be greatly appreciated. Thank You.

Also, when I do get a job, I will give out 2 pizzas.
