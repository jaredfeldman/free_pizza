I was wondering if someone could possibly help me and my family for dinner tonight. Its me and my girlfriend and our two boys. Things have gotten really tough. My girlfriend lost her job due to her getting sick and they wouldn't work with her with flma. She is waiting on a settlement with unemployment. I cant work right now, and i'm waiting on a disability hearing. Food is very limited and we don't get food stamps for a few weeks. It would bring our spirits up some, and i know the boys would like it. I could pick up, so delivery isn't needed. I can pay it forward with no issues as soon as she gets her settlement on her card. I would really really appreciate this...thanks so much for reading!
