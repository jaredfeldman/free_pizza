Some background information.  I just graduated college in June 2012.  I just accepted a job offer for an awesome position but the job has not started yet and I have been living a very limited budget for some time now.  I can offer a picture of us in return and also I also enjoy a healthy conversation with new people.  Went to college in NYC, will be working in Mortgage backed securities and modeling prepayment.
