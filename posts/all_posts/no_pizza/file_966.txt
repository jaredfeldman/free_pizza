My boyfriend kicked me out of his car right in the middle of NYC. All I have on me is my phone. I have been crying my eyes out for the past hour. My purse is still in the car with my wallet, credit cards, id. I have no idea what to do now, I live 50 minutes away on car from the city. I didnt eat all day and would really want something to get my mind off this situation and try to get back home some way.
