Well reddit, I'm slightly drunk and incredibly hungry. I'm trying to grind out notes on this chapter about connective tissue and it is proving to be especially trying. I thought I would beg someone for some pizza to help me pull through this rough ordeal... wait, is this /firstworldproblems?

But... I would really appreciate a pizza. Hell. I might even share it with my engineering room mate, it is up to you to decide how heartless I am!
