So, we are in Terrassa, Espa√±a (Spain). Today we were woken up by police and forced to leave our home. We are activist organizers from France, Spain, and the States. The reason we were kicked out was because we were squatting the derilict home. It made no difference, of course, that we were fixing the place up and providing a safe place for travelers, and others with no home, to sleep. 

No matter if you agree or disagree with our stance on property rights, pizza would go a really long way to making such a crummy day nicer. 

Buenos Dias.
