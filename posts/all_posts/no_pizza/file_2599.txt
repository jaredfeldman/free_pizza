I have a part time job but Pizza Hut (ironic?) Corporate is forcing our store to give less and less hours; I only got around 13 this week. So any offers with pizza hut and I get a 20% discount (I think so, they took our 50% break discount so I don't know if I still get the 20% one). To see my girlfriend costs 150 dollars in gas to pick up and drop her off back at her house. Kinda want the cheesy bites pizza because my co-workers get pissed off every time someone orders one! XD Seriously though they are a huge pain to make...Oh! I also have to save all of my money because I may be homeless/living in my girlfriends closet soon... :(

EDIT: I should add today has been a really depressing day, and frozen chicken isn't exactly comfort food

EDIT2: I actually don't like pizza hut pizza all that much, at least not compared to dominos

Any pizza would be appreciated!
