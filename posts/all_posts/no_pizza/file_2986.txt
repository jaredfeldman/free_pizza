we are cleaning/baby proofing our house for new foster kids. we wont have time to stop cleaning to go out and buy food and don't really have to money to spend on more then just cheap food.being as new baby necessities are very pricey and. we want to get this done and don't want to slow down our momentum and pizza we can eat as we are working. thank you in advance :)
