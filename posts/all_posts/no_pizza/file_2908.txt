A friend asked me if I had some spare cash to help him cover his electric bill, as he recently lost his job. I checked my bank account and saw that I had the money to spare, so I paid his electric for him. Little did I know that payments I had made to other bills hadn't hit my bank account yet (stupid on my part to not verify this) so now I'm a bit in the hole! I'd planned on buying lunch at the cafeteria here at work, but my card was declined. Anyone out there willing to Pizza me? I'll be able to pay it forward on Friday (Pay day)!
