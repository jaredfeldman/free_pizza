This last couple months have been hard for me and my grandpa, early in June my grandma passed away and although we've been managing to get by but it hasn't been easy. Other than when the occasional family member brings over some food we've mostly been living off ramen and sandwich meats until one of us can find a job. (Previously we stayed home because of my grandma and our funds came through her from the state)

Could really just use a pizza to boost morale for me and my grandpa.
