I can't say that I've seen this before, but the moderators of /r/nfl have done a fantastic job for a long time.  They've kept the peace, created a subreddit that has gotten nothing but compliments on how it looks (one of the Reddit Admins swung by to give compliments) and have given an incredible amount of time and energy into the community and updating it.

I'm not sure if their are any regulars over there, but if there are I'm sure you know what a great job these guys have done.  I think offering these guys a pizza would be a great way to show thanks.

There is a list of moderators.  I know off the top of my head that /u/napoleonBonerparts has had a huge role in making the sub looking the way it does, but there are many others that have done a fantastic job.

/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza I ask of you fine people to offer these moderators a pizza.  If you're not sure who to send one to, just ask or send a message, I'm sure they'll gladly direct you to a deserving moderator.

Thanks for your time, and if this is unorthodox, well, it is Random, isn't it?
