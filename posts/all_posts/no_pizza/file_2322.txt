I am new to this my mother told me about it this morning when i came running to her house because i woke up and went to go make my two boys eggs and my burner wouldn't turn on so i have it set to where i can get it back on friday but until my friend comes and picks the boys up for me i can not cook anything for them so if someone could please help they dont get picked up until around six-ish.
