Struggling financially...I work as a line cook and our hours get hacked in the summer time.  I get paid on Monday and have cereal to get me through, so I'm not gonna starve :) but if anyone would like to help, that would be amazing.  And I'd love to pay it forward when I get paid.  I don't like the thought requesting if you aren't also willing to help someone else.
