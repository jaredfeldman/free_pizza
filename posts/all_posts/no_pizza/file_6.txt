(Request) I have given a few things on reddit, a copy of skyrim + 1 year of xbocks live, and soon to be a binder full of magic cards, when i can mail it. I would love, if possible, a kinder egg. I cant get them in the states, and I want the joy, and wonder, and hell, german chocolate.
if you think I am lying, check my submissions and comments, please direct me to where i can get some of this chocolate goodness....
