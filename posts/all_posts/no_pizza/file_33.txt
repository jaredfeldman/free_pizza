I posted yesterday but had no luck, sorry for the repost. 

I recently moved closer to work, and lost my job, so now I have to try and pay bills instead of buying furniture, so I live in an empty apartment and could just really use a pizza. I know my account is new, i was directed here by a friend. I live in Oak Ridge TN. Thank you.
