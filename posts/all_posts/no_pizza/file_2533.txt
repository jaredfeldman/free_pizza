Student in a lot of debt, would prefer not to add another $10 for pizza to that pile. I just have 1 more month to go until I can defend my thesis... I've written 200 pages and have about 50 more to go. Once I defend and get a job, I'll become a pizza-giver: I'll give out 2 pizzas for every pizza I've gotten as a student!
