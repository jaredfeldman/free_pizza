Being forced to quit my job (long story), have a holiday coming up that is paid for (luckily) but leaves me literally penniless until I can find something else to do for work, not to mention christmas presents for the people I love. I'm sitting at work today, by myself, coming to terms with the fact that these are my last few days until unemployment happens.

A cheese and pineapple would literally make the rest of my year. I'll reward you with love in any form I can.
