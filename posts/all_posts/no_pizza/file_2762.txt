I've been having a couple of harsh months (lung surgery, recovering, severe nerve damage, no money, on disability, etc.). Because of the amount of pain I am dealing with I don't get around to much. Overall, my dream is to become a pulmonary/critical care specialist to help people like me. I wasn't going to go back to school this semester because of the pain (and not having any money) but I decided this week to still keep pursuing my education. So I got a loan for school and was approved, and classes start next Wednesday. I am very excited. 

Edit: Also because I want to eat pizza on my living room floor while watching all of netflix.
