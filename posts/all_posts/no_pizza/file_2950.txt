I am new and have no idea if I am doing this right or if this can even be done.  I was on Facebook and somehow clicked on this guy's page where I saw he was going to a food bank and got denied.  I have no idea who he is.  He sounds hungry and I'd be giving him a pizza myself, but am disabled and broke until my tiny check comes next month. I can post a link to his FB page (don't know if I should include it here) and hopefully someone can help him out. I read about what you all are doing here, on CNN news site a while back, and was so touched by this effort.  You all are amazing!  Please help me get this guy some food. :)
