I don't want a pity pizza, so I'll just list one awesome thing that's happened to me today and try and have an awesome moment pizza.

Loads of bad shit happening, deportation, ect. Really sad. Find a wallet on the street. Look inside. 800$+ dollars. Decide to steal it. Few minutes later, reconsider and take it to the bus station. Lady there looks inside and see's the $800, looks at me surprised, and gives me a smile. She asks for my name, and I say "Your friendly neighborhood Normalman." She laughs and wishes me a good day.

In Quebec, Canada, so I don't know how international pizza orders work, if it can't happen, no worries. Good day c:
