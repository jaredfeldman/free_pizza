Hey RAoP. I've been pretty down lately, some dark thoughts been going through my head, I think a big part of that is my uncle (whom I live with) is suspected of having Bladder Cancer. I can't describe to you or put into context how unfortunate this is for our family, I mean cancer is usually horrible but on top of the hardship our family is facing this is absolutely devastating. My uncle, my mother, and me are supported by my grandmother. We all live in the same fairly small house, I'm the only one who has a (low wage retail) job and I'm working there and going to school so that soon I can get out of here alive, things are so stressful here. I usually wake up to people arguing and yelling at each other, my car needs a new transmission, I need tons of dental work, I really don't feel like going on a lot of the time but I stay positive and just try to reflect on the fact that I am working and making good grades.

So, I hope that didn't bore you, I didn't get too detailed. As for a pizza, if someone feels like getting me one that would be cool as I am broke until Friday, and we don't have much food here, also we have roaches so a lot of the food is contaminated. Ugh. A pepperoni + bell pepper pie from someone would really give me a little hope.

Thanks for reading...
