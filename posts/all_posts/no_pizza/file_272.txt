So, me and the fam will be having sandwiches for dinner tonight- no big but I'd like to surprise them with something a little more pizza'ie.

Problem is- I don't get paid till Friday. Yikes, right? So, what do you think we trade pizza favors? One for today, for one for you this coming weekend or when ever (hold it over my head like a mob boss, good conversation point).
