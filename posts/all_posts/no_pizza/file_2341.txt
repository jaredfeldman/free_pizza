Greetings, my generous redditors! I just got done with working three consecutive 12 hour shifts at Big Box retail store in IT for Tax Free Weekend. 

I'm now in my first day off after the ordeal but 'lo by account is not large enough to bring forth to me a delicious pizza to melt away the sorrows of the weekend until Friday! If anyone would like to help in this ordeal please let me know!

Located in Tennessee.
