Yesterday, I helped a fellow redditor out by finding a video he's been searching for in return for some pizza. [Link to thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/19u7rr/i_will_order_you_pizza_for_the_right_song/)  

However, since he's in another country, his credit card couldn't go through, and he was unable to place an order online. So he sent me $24 through Paypal. :)

I've been in a sort of a rough patch, and haven't had a decent meal in weeks. So I was really looking forward to having pizza for dinner on a Saturday night. Unfortunately, I found out Papa John's and Pizza Hut don't accept Paypal. 

Now I'm not sure if I'd be breaking any rules by doing this. If I am, please let me know and I'll take this down. If not, then I would be more than happy to send someone $24 through Paypal if they could order some pizza for me.
