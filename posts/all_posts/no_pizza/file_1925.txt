Long story short: i got kicked out of my house for asking to take my computer to a LAN party. (i am NOT exaggerating)

for the past couple weeks i have been staying with my dad &amp; his girlfriend, but yesterday i ran out of the money i had been saving. I don't get paid for another 2 days and i am absolutely famished.
