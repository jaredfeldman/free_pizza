Hey guys,

I promised myself I wouldn't do this because I'd feel terrible, but after not eating anything for the past days (except German chocolate), I figured I would at least try this. 

So here's the [true] story: Student (of course), living in Canada (parents live in Michigan]. I am absolutely broke as my most recent funds were drained into parking tickets and a plane ticket for my brother's wedding. 

I'm not going to complain that my situation is worse than anyone else's-- I have my sweet hamster asleep on my leg and I have season 4 of 30 Rock, so I'm bearing with it. *swallows pride* But I'm starving. If you're generous enough to send me pizza, give me your address and as soon as I have money for shipping I will send you out all the German chocolate I have, as well as a post card and a bag of Reeses Peanut Butter cups. I will do anything to make it even with you. And be your pen pal. :)

Thanks in advance. Seriously.
