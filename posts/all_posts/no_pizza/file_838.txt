I just got fired from my job and I'm broke. I don't have any money or food in my house, I've been eating bread and rice all week, and on top of that I signed a NC/NDA where I was fired from and I can't even get another job working on the same type of stuff that I know how to work on (fixing cell phones, computers, and mostly reballing PS3 and XBOX 360s) due to the NC/NDA agreement they had me sign. I'm not sure what to do and I'm really hungry, if someone could please send me something like pizza or foods coupon I would really appreciate it. Thanks
