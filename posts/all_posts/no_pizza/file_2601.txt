I don't like asking for things (hence me using a side account), but my mom and I could really use some food. I haven't been able to find a job, and she works ultra hard, but w/o child support we can't even pay rent. I think the only thing we have to eat is some canned pineapples. If you want proof I'm an active redditor and not just a beggar, I'll send a screen shot of me logged into my real account or w/e. I just don't want my friends to know about my situation. Thank you for this wonderful website! (sorry I don't have any cats.)
