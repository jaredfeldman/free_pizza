I'm a student, and my fridge is empty. I would normally bike to the store and buy groceries for the week, but somehow I misplaced my debit card, and I don't have enough cash to feed myself.

I would really appreciate a pizza until I can get to the bank tomorrow. I get my paycheck early next week, so I can pay it forward then. : )
