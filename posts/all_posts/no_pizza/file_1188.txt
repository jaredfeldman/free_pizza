Hey fellow pizza-lovers. 

It is coming to the end of the semester and I am about at my breaking point. Me and my roommate are bio majors (senior year) and we are currently taking microbiology. FUCKING. HELL. I don't want to go on too much of a rant here, but essentially, our professor is not a very nice person. When hurricane Sandy came rolling through, given that we had missed at least a week and a half of school, most professors took this into consideration and removed certain assignments that were due considering time constraints. NOT THIS BITCH. In fact, she added onto the syllabus. In the end, we had a little more than 400 pts due in the last week of class in an 800pt course. I have never been so stressed in my entire college career and I think my roommate is about to lose it. 

Our freezer is empty. We run to the caf when we can (considering its not closed because our school sucks sometimes), but it has been the same food since the beginning of the semester, and quite frankly, makes me piss out of my asshole. With our final in the class coming up this Tuesday, it would really be an unbelievably generous treat to have some pizza to help us study for this test.

tl;dr Poor, frustrated bio majors looking for some brain food.
