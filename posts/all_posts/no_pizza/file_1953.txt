EDIT: Location - Ypsilanti, MI

I get paid biweekly and the beginning of the month drained my accounts (rent etc.) Though I don't want this to become some sappy story. I'm just really hungry and would love if anyone from reddit could help.

I can assure you I'll buy someone a pizza once my next paycheck comes in.
