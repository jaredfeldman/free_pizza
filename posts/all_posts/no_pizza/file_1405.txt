So I moved back home to Southeastern WI at the start of March when I could not find a new job. As soon as I got home a friend resigned and recommended me for his position. I'm just waiting for them to decide what to do with the position.

In the mean time I sure could go for some cheese. Especially tonight. Want a sob story? How about this. I bought myself a $6.00 block of cheese last week. Made two sandwiches from it and then my dad ate the rest. In one sitting.
