Hello Redditors!

Like the title says, my girlfriend and I are writing a "How to lease your first apartment" guide for all the new freshman and sophomores who are going to start signing leases next week. See, around here the apartment companies build up this hype that all of the best apartments will be gone if you don't sign on Oct 5th. This is such shit! We were able to both get out of really shitty leases and move into a great place halfway through the year and pay less than what . By perpetuating this myth, the leasing offices show kids shitty apartments and make them believe that these are the best ones that are "left" and that the students should pay $400 - $600 per PERSON for these shit holes. 

Basically, we are writing a guide for these students so they wont get screwed. I know that you guys are namely good at giving out pizza (which would be greatly appreciated) but any good advice you have for leasing an apartment is appreciated as well! 

Edit: On Illinois State University campus. Any /r/ilstu -ers out there?
