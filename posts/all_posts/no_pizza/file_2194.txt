Yo.

So I'm about to move across the country (Florida to Pennsylvania) with my girlfriend, and I just paid the deposit on the new place, first month's rent, and the pro-rate for my current apartment, so I've been stretched ramen-thin for a week and a half or so. I don't get paid 'till Friday, and a pizza would be pretty sweet. 

Not gonna lie; I won't starve if I don't get one, but it's been a pretty stressful week, and it'd help the ol' morale. I've done the verification system and such.

Thanks!
