Hello fellow redditors. I will be very honest, I am one of the people who have come here after seeing the media coverage. Well I have been here before, but mostly just lurking. I haven't been able to afford much for myself lately, so that's why I haven't really participated much here, but it is something I plan on doing once I get some more funds in the bank account.

So here's my story. Tomorrow is one of my really good friends 23rd birthday. It's been a rough year so far for both of us (both had breakups around the same time) and since then, our friendship has really become a lot stronger. I've been in the negatives in my bank account the last two weeks and I can't afford to get him anything for his birthday (it's a byob party and I don't even have any b to b) He's having about 6 or so people over tomorrow to celebrate and I think it would be awesome if we could get some birthday pizza for the party. I know there's a lot of people out there who would better benifit from pizza, but this would mean a whole lot to me if someone could help me out tomorrow evening. I'll pay it forward when I can afford!
