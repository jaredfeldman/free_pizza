Hi all, Im a 20yr university student struggling thorugh a Bsc in maths. Money is tight for all students but im constantly finding my self stuck in an endless loop of C's. Pizza would be amazing and would lift my spirts but as I live in Auckland, New Zealand I highly doubt there is anyone who can actually buy pizza for me over here... Thanks for reading anyway.
