I've toyed with asking for a pizza, but i've had some help from friends and family these past weeks, but going on 2 interviews and not landing the job has really kicked me down a notch.  I also worried about tipping the driver, how does that work if someone donates a card? I wouldn't want a pizza if it meant stiffing the delivery guy...
