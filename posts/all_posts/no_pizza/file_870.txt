[This posting](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/iad11/what_can_i_do_to_survive_really_strapped_for_cash/) by redditor katehawk910 makes it sound like his/her situation could use some pizza lovin' to alleviate the money he/she would have to spend on food. I'm at work at the moment, are there any other redditors who would be able to help this person out?
