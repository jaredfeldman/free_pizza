Earlier this week I had a $115 water bill due to error and I do not know if I have to pay it or not. I am on a fixed income with three kids and three adults living under one roof, I have very little food in the cupboard and fridge with my food pantry giving out food next week.  My kids are tired of sandwiches and pasta (which my live in baby sitter makes while I work all day). I do have a verification code but no camera for proof because I cannot afford one.
