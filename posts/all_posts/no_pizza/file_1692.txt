My hard working dad works as a wholesale selling electronics in NY and business is slow lately and he isn't making money like he used to. My mother is a stay-at-home mother who has never had a job in her life and our family has a very tight budget. While some people may say to get off yar lazy arse and get a job, quite frankly in my situation its impossible as of right now. I'm too busy to get a job again to maintain my grades and enough sleep each night so that option is out of the picture.

All I'm asking for is a simple medium/large pizza, that's all, it would really make my day for a stranger on the internet to perform such an act of kindness.
