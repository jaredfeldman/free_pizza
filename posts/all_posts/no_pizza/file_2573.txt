Reposting this hoping we might end up with some food..

...in the middle of Ohio.

As the bucket of pennies suggests we're particularly broke and warm food is hard to come. We're not getting paid until mid-February (and some of us are still looking for work). We'd greatly appreciate any help.. and a warm pizza would be great.

On our way we just passed a Chinese place and missed the lunch special (only affordable thing) by a couple of minutes so the possibility of warm food is still too real in our minds.
