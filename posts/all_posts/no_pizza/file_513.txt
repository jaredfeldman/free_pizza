I'm pretty broke and have nothing to eat. Nor the ability cook something without giving my self food poisoning, so please give me some pizza! In return i can write a poem about anything you want, i'm no Carol Anne Duffy but i'll write it to the best of my ability. Please someone respond. I will be completely willing to return the favour as soon as i get some money. Thanks for taking a look.

Also i'm very sad, but a pizza would make me happy!
