Hi, I have a friend who is in need of help. He lives in Eau Claire, WI, and has just gotten to work for a long night shift. At the moment, he is extremely strapped for cash and hasn't been able to afford much food this week and doesn't get paid till the next. As a college student myself, I unfortunately am not able to send some cash his way right now. If any redditors could please help him out, I'd greatly appreciate it.
