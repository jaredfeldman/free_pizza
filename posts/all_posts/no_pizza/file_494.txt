No sob story here, no bullshit, I just want some pizza. If you aren't sure and you want to do something good then give your pizza to someone who "needs" it. 

I'm just coming here to ask for a random act of pizza from a stranger. 

I don't expect anything and definitely think that the people who really need food should be the main concern, but some pizza would cheer me up and I would really appreciate it.
