I bought a new motorcycle yay!  http://imgur.com/a/lZZQz

Just got my helmet and gauntlets in today. Just excited to share, not really relevant.

 I haven't ordered a pizza in the 2 years I've been in Ames.  I just don't like the idea of a poor guy driving a pizza out to me and feel obligated to tip well.  Unfortunately I don't have much money so I don't order pizza.

That didn't stop me from buying a bike 0_o.  I only eat once a day, usually dinner after I get done working all day.  It doesn't bother me, in-fact my stomach is tiny now and I don't even notice I'm hungry.

I might go take a nap but I've always heard about this subreddit but missing the domino's pizza contest made me hungry for pizza, it'll subside after a day or 2 I hope but in the mean-time I wanted to post.

I went from 6'1 186 pounds (still skinny) to 163 pounds apparently this not eating stuff is really good at cutting weight.  I was trying to put on weight (muscle) though.  Pizza doesn't really help with that though, don't know why I have a craving for it.
