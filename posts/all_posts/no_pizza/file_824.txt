The girlfriend and I were sitting at home and after repeatedly checking the cabinets she decided she'd rather be hungry than eat any more Ramen. Personally I could eat the stuff every day for another couple of months, but she's a little more high maintenance than I am. We're in between checks and had a ticket (10 over) recently that got rid of nearly all my disposable income.
She'd deeply appreciate the gooey cheesy deliciousness and I really wouldn't mind myself!
