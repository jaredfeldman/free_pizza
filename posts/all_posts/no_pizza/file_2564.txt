I recently just had surgery to have my upper and lower jaw broken. My jaw was wired shut for 6 weeks. The only thing i ate other than liquid was mashed potatoes...so now that I can eat solids, I'm giving Reddit first chance to feed me. 

P.S. I have 0 dollars as i have not been working and my mom will not pay for me as she is not a supporter of Pizza (shame on her).
