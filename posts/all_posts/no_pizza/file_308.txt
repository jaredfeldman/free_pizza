Here's a list of current edible food (edible, keyword people):

1. 4 Eggo waffles (syrup is Dated July 2009, we're good like that).
2. 1/4 box generic Cinnamon Toast Crunch - no milk.
3. 1/3 bag Stale Cheetos.
4. Hot cocoa powder (no marshmallows included, what are we, animals?)
5. 1 slice of American cheese, no bread or crackers.
6. 1/10 Bear of Honey (went well with the waffles last 2 days tbqh).
7. 10-15 otter pops (pi√±a colada flavor, useless).

If anyone would be willing to help out a couple of dudes in need, I'd definitely pay it forward as soon as I can (most likely a couple weeks). Keep in mind, that is a literal stock check of edible food. There is no hidden Ramen or sandwich materials, and the last of our funds went towards keeping the cats fed.
