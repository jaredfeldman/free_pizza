I was away on business for the first two weeks of August.  I've been back for the last two weeks, but I've been extremely busy with work so I haven't been grocery shopping.  After leaving the office on about the 9th 14 hour or so day, I realized I had left my wallet in our Core location.  While this normally wouldn't be a big deal, that is the only location I don't have access to outside of business hours.  I found this out as I was at the grocery store getting ready to buy some food (I figured it was time).  Now I'm hungry and tired. Oh, and I have to head to the office for a maintenance window in another 7 or so hours.  Any generous souls out there?

Edit:  I should sleep instead.  I realize I can get back to my wallet tomorrow and a few hours hungry isn't going to kill me.
