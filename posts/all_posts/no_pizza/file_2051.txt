I had no idea this subreddit existed. Very cool stuff.

Anyway, I'm supposedly going to start working an on-campus gig for the University of Arizona soon, but the person responsible for the job has been dragging their feet hardcore. Bank account is in the shit, I don't own any credit cards, and the only thing I have in my house is a can of tuna. I don't even like tuna.

Probably not as deserving as a single mom, but college kids gotta eat, too! And if you're a local I will take you out for a drink once I start working :)
