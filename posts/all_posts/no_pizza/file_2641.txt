I will pay it forward as soon as I get paid, as this subreddit has helped renew my faith in humanity. 
I'm one of those college grads (Master's degree) with a massive amount of debt working in a soul-sucking non-related field, and have not budgeted enough for food this month. I get paid on Friday, but would love a good pizza tonight, and low and behold my funds won't allow for it. So, any help would be so much appreciated.
