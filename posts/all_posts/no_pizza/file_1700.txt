I am 19 and recently became homeless, I just got out of the hospital to find out that my medical card had been canceled and I cannot pay for mine. Also, my boyfriend was in the hospital a few days prior and has a T12 L4 fracture in his spine. We have been staying at a friends house for a little bit but they are low on food and we have been eating ramen and cheese sandwiches for the past week. I would like to treat him to a pizza, but I have no money at all. I do have proof I need help with my (and my boyfriend's) prescription and our hospital bands.
