My sister is home from college break, and we're going to watch a movie together since we don't get to see each other very much. I'd be willing to trade an amateurish face removal in Photoshop for it (the higher res the picture, the better it'll be done).

I'll also send you examples of my face removals if you'd like. Imgur won't let me upload them from my phone.
