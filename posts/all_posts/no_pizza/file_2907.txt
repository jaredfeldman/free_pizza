Throwaway as my only other account is a gonewild one :p. Anyhow my boyfriend i just moved into a new apartment in seattle, paid all the fees, deposit, first months rent and moving costs and even had some cash left over before our next paychecks to buy food and necessary stuffs. Came to get our keys this morning,  all our stuff in cars and a moving truck to find out the landlord had expected us implicitly to pay a two hundred fifty dollar fee when she agreed that our cute black lab rescue, bowser, could live with us. She in no uncertain terms told is it was the deposit or no dog, we paid up. So now we are very hungry  and we could use a pizza- not bowser of course; he has lots of food. Which will hopefully remain a last resort.
