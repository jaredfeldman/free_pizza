The other night the alternator belt slipped off the engine and a coolant pipe burst. The power steering gave out and I had a bit of a workout getting the boat home with a steam cloud drifting behind and the emergency blinkers on. Boom! Scary, but everyone's safe. It does mean that my next pay check is tied up.

Today our 9 month old was sleepy nursing and ended up taking a chunk out of /u/mrsslowloris nipple and now she's feeling a little nursing shy and she'd like a pizza tonight. I do have a picture of the bloody nipple with a chunk missing if you need proof. Thanks!
