So I live with my BF we are both unemployed currently. He has been searching for a job for the past 3 months after being laid off with no such luck, which is really beginning to take a toll on him. I have recently lost my job last week as well. Bills/rent are coming up in the next week and we are still scrounging/selling whatever we possibly can. We have began running low on food within the past week (instant rice, cereal, and ramen). were afraid that if we go to buy groceries before bills/rent are paid off, we will not have enough to pay them. A pizza would be a nice change for dinner and quite possibly even help my BF to keep his head up and not get discouraged his job hunting.
