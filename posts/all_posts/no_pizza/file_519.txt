I really really really hate asking for things, especially from strangers. I lost a bunch of hours on my last check, and have been surviving on the 4 dollars u had left after rent, ramen is nasty. If you want to help someone out, this guy is desperate for some protein. Thank you even if you don't help. 


Edit. I am in Peoria illinois, if that helps. I am also down to walk to your house and clean for food at this point in the day if you live in ptown.
