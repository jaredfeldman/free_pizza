I'm working part time now, my hours were recently cut, and I can't even afford to pay my current bills. I am about to get a new job in insurance sales, which will cure my financial woes (and will be able to pay it forward). However, I have a class and an exam to take and then I have to apply for a license, and it's still gonna be several weeks. In the meantime, I'm super hungry. And pizza just sounds so damn good. I'm in Virginia, if that matters.
