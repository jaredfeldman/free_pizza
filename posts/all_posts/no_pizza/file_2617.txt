I've recently been put on a rather large project from my employer. Combine that with trying to learn some light web development and trying to improve my understanding of XHTML and CSS 3.0, and I am put in a position where it seems like I have no free time. Money has been tight, so while I have a budget that keeps me fed, it's mostly just rice and other odd little things that don't cost a whole lot. I think if someone were awesome enough to gift me a pizza right now, it would help me stay sane right now. :)

Would certainly pizza it forward after this large project is done near the middle of the month (right before Christmas it seems).

Would also be willing to assist someone in simple or perhaps slightly complicated HTML/CSS work if requested. I'm sure I can find a little bit of time to answer questions or give advice. That's pretty much my forte. Just don't ask me about jQuery. That seems to be my kryptonite!
