my recently ex boyfriend stole my purse from my apartment. seeing as i live paycheck to paycheck and i don't get paid for another week and a half, i have no way to pay for anything. i have nothing in the bank, and until i get new credit cards (i reported them stolen), i can't even buy groceries this week. 

when i get paid, i can be sure to pay back/pay forward any kind of help anyone here could help me with. thanks for reading and thank all of you for what you do.
