I'm waiting for my G.I. Bill to come in, hopefully by the end of the month. Until then I am stuck with 99 cent loaves of bread and peanut butter which has also run out. I have 3 dollars in my account and I'm starving. Make a random request and I will fulfill it!

Since I made this post so late I don't think I will see any response. Thanks for those who read this post. Good luck in your RAOP!
