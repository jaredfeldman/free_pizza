Well, here goes. I'm a 19 year old male student, living with my dad. He left for a hiking trip to Costa Rico. He left me some money to go grocery shopping, which I deposited into my bank account. Unfortunately, I lost my wallet 3 days ago, which had my debit card in it, and can not go grocery shopping. I contacted my bank the day after I lost my wallet, and they said that my new one should arrive in the mail on Monday. I have eaten all of the edible food in my house, and am now kinda stuck. If there are any kind souls out there that can help, I will gladly pay it forward ASAP.
