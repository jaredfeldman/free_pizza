I've been unemployed for awhile. Not due to a lack of effort. I feel like I've hit rock bottom. I'm going on my second week eating dollar store oatmeal. My hormonal rage is making me crave something more. If anyone is in a giving mood, message me. I'd even be happy with a cheesy bread and little desserty thing.
