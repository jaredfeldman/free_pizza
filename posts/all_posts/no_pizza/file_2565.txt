Sorry about the throw-away account, but my fiance reads Reddit as well.

Currently he's strapped for cash and is just making his rent and bills. He has a job lined up and will start in September. Currently he is living off rice and taco bell sauce packets. 

I just want to make his Friday night/weekend just a little bit better. 

If you could help at all, it would be much appreciated.
