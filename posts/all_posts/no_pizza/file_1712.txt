Hey Redditors,

It has been awhile since I've been on here. January has been a really rough month and I'm just having a pretty crap day. Here's how January went for me. Car broke down at the beginning of the month, which means I've been busing until payday on Friday. My Grammy passed away suddenly from complications from lung cancer on January 11th. Being alone in WA meant a very complicated and extended grieving process as I couldn't get down to Oregon until the day before the funeral. Came back up and found that on top of my car being broken down, my tire went flat as it sat there completely still and parked meaning I'll have to get it fixed and replace a tire now. Then yesterday I was on Skype with my boyfriend who is an Airman and already far away in Omaha and he got orders. They're for Japan. And he leaves in April. We had plans for his leave in June. Those won't happen anymore. So today I am just sad and teary and majorly craving pizza. I do promise to hop back on after Payday and pay it forward, I know how much a pizza can brighten a day!
