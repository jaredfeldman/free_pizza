I'm staying up all night to get a headway on an assignment about soil (duller than dull) which will be one of the last papers I write before I graduate this May with (hopefully) a sparkly lovely degree. Naturally my body has decided I need to suffer and has bestowed me with the finest  mind-numbing-no-breathing-allowed-just-give-up-already head cold it could muster. I refuse to give in! Pizza will be my salvation.
