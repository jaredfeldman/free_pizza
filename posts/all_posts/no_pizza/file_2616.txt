I'm lucky that internet comes part and parcel with my rent. I work retail grocery and summer hours are murder on the wallet. I have to hustle managers just to get a good 20-25 hours a week, when I used to push the part time hour limit. 

I hate begging, but my stomach is scoffing at me and calling me a proud asshole. So here I am :). Just one is all I ask.
