Hey guys. I hate to ask for hep but Im kinda going through a rough time atm. I'm a single mom with an 8 year old autistic son named Logan. I've been struggling lately since I got laid off from my last job and we are literaly out of food now. I am starting a part time job tomorrow morning but it'll be 3 weeks before I'll receive my first paycheck and I'm currently awaiting results on my food stamp application. If anyone could please help us out with a pizza tonight it'd be a huge huge blessing, ty so much!
