So, my curcumstance is that I am hungry. I live with my girlfriend and a friend and we have pretty much no food in the house. We have bread, but we ran out of raman yesterday and it is raining. Yesterday all I ate was a bowl of raman and two pieces of bread, and today I have been looking at the clock and thinking about pizza. I am not starving to death, but I would like a warm pizza to fill our stomachs. Also, I lost my wallet with my cards and a bit of cash over a week ago, I am not a deadbeat, but just having a hardish time. Can a man get a pizza for my girlfriend and brother? (refereed to as friend earlier as we are not blood related or related by marriage) I live in California, in Los Angeles County. I will give anymore info as requested.

I come from another forum and I asked if they could help by giving a coupon for a free pizza or something and they suggested I come here. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.
