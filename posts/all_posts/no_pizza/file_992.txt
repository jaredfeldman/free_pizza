I've recently moved over to London  but I kinda messed up on funds and left myself short. Right now I'm looking at the 23p in my pocket and wondering what I could get with that to buy some food. I have no food in the kitchen and no one over here to help me. Spent the day hunting high and low for a job (which it looks like I might have by tomorrow) and I haven't eaten all day. Please help RAOP.
