I tried to do an askreddit a while back about a friend who faces time. It didn't do well so I deleted it. I guess that explains my user name.

I heard about this reddit through the same friend that introduced me to this reddit site.

I have some pics of my place. I don't do so well. My friend said I should use imgur.com.

Edit: I read on sidebar. I am in US but my first language is not English.

Edit: Oh yeah. I could use a pizza!
