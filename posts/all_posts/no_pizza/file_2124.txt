I've been working at an Italian joint in North/ Western Michigan over the summer.. They sell pizza but I never ate there due to unsanitary and poor working conditions. Today I went in for my shift and I'd been completely taken off the schedule, without any warning. What a bummer! And last night I spent a few hundred dollars on my boyfriend's birthday presents.
 I'm working on a scrapbook for him now, while singing Gimme pizza.. Slow.
"Uh, did I happen to say, I want pizza?"
Thanks for reading.
