So, basically, I am a college student back from spring break.  I had my entire wallet stolen, so I have no credit or debit cards or any cash on hand to buy food.  Nothing in the fridge either. If anyone could help me out, I would happily pizza it foward when my cards come in the mail. Thanks Reddit!
