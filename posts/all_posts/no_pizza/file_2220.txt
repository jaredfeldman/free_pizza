Hey everybody, I just found out about this subreddit and I am requesting a pizza pie. Simply put, my dad has been in the hospital for a long time and is awaiting a procedure for this upcoming week. My mom is always at work and the hospital with him and whenever I'm home I have to find something to cook. Any kind of help would be amazing. Thanks.
