So first of all, this account IS a throwaway. Truth be told, I'm embarrassed I'm at this point again, and also, my good friends have my actual account info and I'd just rather them not know I'm here. I have received pizza here once before. My first Reddit cakeday was in August. I'm more than willing to link someone to my real account and provide some sort of proof that I am who I say I am. I just don't want everyone to know! Though I am willing to give thanks from my real account. It's a different feeling, afterwards.

Okay if you made it past that, the short story is that I'm, like most, out of money. I get paid on Friday but until then I'm scavenging. I'm a kind hearted person but I know there are tons of people deserving of food! I'm just hoping someone takes pity on me. Pretty please! I'd be so grateful.

TL:DR - Pizza?

Edit: I live in Washington State.
