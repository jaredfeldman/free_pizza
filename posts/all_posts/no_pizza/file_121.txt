I quit my job to go abroad for 30 days.  Not the best decision of my life, but I would never get the opportunity to take a trip like I did again.  While I was gone, due to circumstances outside my control, I lost my apartment.  So, I come back after 30 days to no job and no place to live.  My roommate was kind enough to start packing for me after he had packed his own things.

Now I'm here, living with my parents who can't afford to take me in.  I've just got a job (I made seven dollars yesterday! Yay!) but, can't really afford to spend anything on anything extra.  I'd really just like a pizza.

I live in Alaska.  If anyone is willing to hook me up let me know.
