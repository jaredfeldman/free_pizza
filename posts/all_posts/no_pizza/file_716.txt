I've been going through a bit of a rough summer, emotionally. I feel unmotivated and uninspired. To top it off, the other day my parents told me they don't think I'm ever going to make it in college... what a way to bring someone down. We had a huge fight and I'm currently at my boyfriend's house. I haven't had a delicious pizza made to my perfection in a long, long time and I'm desperately searching for something to lift my spirits.

*In return for a pizza, I will photoshop a panda bear with a machine gun wearing a beer hat, and holding a pizza, riding on a tyrannosaurus rex with a huge explosion in the background.*

Thanks!
