It's been a rough summer here. It may be cold in the D but it's pretty cold in Flint Town too. My roommate totaled his car, we were living five deep in here paying 100/person in rent and 3/5 roommates moved out this week.  We are both unemployed at the moment, I just got hired in somewhere but I won't get paid  for another two weeks.  We are kind of shitting bricks about what we are going to eat.  All of our money is going to utilities, and to pay rent.  If there is a kind redditor out there who could extend some sort of relief my roommate and I would be so incredibly grateful.  We just need a little bit of relief until we can get some food assistance.
