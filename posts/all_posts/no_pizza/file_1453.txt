Just got off a 14 hour day courtesy of the holiday weekend, and my wife is at my sisters house for her baby shower. New appartment, so no food i know how to cook, and she is still waitin on a transfer to the local kroger so we've been short her check for two weeks.

I figure someone out in the houston area that enjoy's their beer wouldn't mind helping out a hungry guy who spent all day filling up shelves with budweiser to keep all you drunks out there happy :)
