Hey guys, my per diem check never came and we were counting on itWe are paying rent today (late as is)And we won't have any money left for the rest of the week. I budget like crazy but my SO had to go away to.work for a week, so he had to pay to love separately from us. So we are very behind and broke.Well the check hasn't come and was suppose to be here a week ago.I will return the favor in a few weeks when we get all caught up.Anyone want to help a girl out?Much appreciated!
