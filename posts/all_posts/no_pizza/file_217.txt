Local purveyor of pizza slices, [Luigi's Slice] (https://www.facebook.com/luigisfungarden), has $2 pepperoni and cheese slices on Tuesdays. While I could have procured one of these, it would've left me flat broke for the rest of the week. Last night, willpower was working overtime, and I pulled through.

... This morning, I just had a bowl of Grape Nuts — which I typically do enjoy — but for whatever reason, the image of Luigi's perfectly spiced oregano-laden sauce stabbed my brain, and subsequently my gut, relentlessly.

Today is $3 for any slice, and I feel my willpower waning hard. At this point, any pizza would suffice — it is merely convenient (and awesome) that the cheaper option is also among the best in the area.

Any help to satisfy this pizza craving would be much appreciated, I promise to pay it forward (in-kind, to the extent I'm able) by next $2 Tuesday!
