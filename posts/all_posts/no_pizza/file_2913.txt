Just like the the post says. Tried to make it til the next paycheck (tomorrow), but ran out of food yesterday. Haven't eaten today at all and I figured I'd try RAOP. Someone on reddit before sent me crispy M&amp;Ms before so I know people are nice enough to do stuff like this. I can provide proof of brokeness and am definitely willing to pay the pizza forward to either the giver or someone else next week. Even as early as tomorrow. I can provide whatever verification necessary
