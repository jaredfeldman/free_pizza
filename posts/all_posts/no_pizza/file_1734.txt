I live in Auckland, New Zealand, so remember that. This can be part of the thing that I do. I have a car, so anything within 5 minutes of [this](http://maps.google.co.nz/maps?q=orakei+basin&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x6d0d49b351cf3399:0x2a00ef6165e1e540,Orakei+Basin&amp;gl=nz&amp;ei=rjG3TtrrB9CRiQeFpp3tAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCEQ8gEwAA) (like 5-10 minutes or so) is fair game. I can probably make it down to the waterfront. Other cool areas are the former quarry turned residential area, the Auckland Domain, a marina, and an old train yard.

I have a Camera and a tripod, so I can take a picture of myself doing something crazy.

Edit: The pickups here are quite a bit cheaper, so if we organize it right, I can pick it up instead of a delivery. I am also partial to the Mr. Wedge from Dominoes, but beggars can't be choosers. :)
