I don't want to water fast for a week. My stomach hurts and I'm not going to have any money for at least a week. I work hard as a freelance writer every day but wages are 1-2 pennies a word. When rent is $600 and I earn $1,000 in a month, that doesn't pan out for insurance, food and the other responsibilities of life. I have no insurance now, nor do I have my car inspected. Poor is an understatement. I'm days away from being homeless.
