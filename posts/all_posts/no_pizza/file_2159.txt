Yesterday I was pickpocketed while taking the subway to my job. I don't have any idea how this happened as I tend to watch out for stuff like this, but I am now without any cash and I don't use a banking service. I don't get paid for another week and a half, and I decided to use the $10 I had on my dresser at home to feed my cat for a week hoping I would find a way to get some food money soon.
