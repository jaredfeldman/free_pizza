So I'm sitting in the living room of a lady friend of mine shortly after we have watched the movie Bad Teacher.  We are hungry, but sadly, shortly before I arrived for the movie, the contents of her refridgerator was removed for a little bit of maintnence and de-icing.  The dumpster is full of lost dreams of dinner, that sadly spoiled.  Anyways... I introduced this girl to Reddit tonight, and we happen to be hungry.  After about an hour of laughing our asses off at her reddit innocence, I remembered Random acts of Pizza. We want her first time to be unforgetable and satisfactory. THANKS!
