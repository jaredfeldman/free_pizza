Hi, Reddit:

I have no idea if my reason is considered a proper reason for asking for a pizza, so forgive me if this seems like a lame request, haha.  

I forgot my wallet at home this morning and went to work.  Now I'm in the office and I don't have lunch.  Would really like a small pizza or just a slice to tide me over until I can go home tonight.
