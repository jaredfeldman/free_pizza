My mom was recently in a car accident, and she's been having shoulder/neck/back problems that she has to get MRI's done for and she has to visit her doctor frequently. My parents usually supply me with some money when they can, but I rejected their offer this time because their $20 copays are piling up and they barely have any food in the cupboards themselves, so they need the money much more than I do. This is my first post on here, and I realize there may be people that need food much more than I do, so please help them first. Pizza would last me a few days. God bless.
