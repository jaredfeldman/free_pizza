My car is non-op atm, and I'm completely starving. I would order in but, my credit card is dead empty. I have small fortune sitting in Paypal, but it is currently un-usable to me to get food and sustenance.

[I am a freelance graphic designer with over 6 years of experience](http://ethereal-design.net/), so, if you need anything done in trade, hit me up, I really need some dinner, and possibly a soda. Alternatively, if you would just prefer I pay you in paypal, that is quite alright as well :) Help feed a starving artist!
