Hey, RAOP! I'm having a rather crappy day. Last night I stayed at my boyfriends apartment, and at 1:15 in the morning, they towed my car because I parked in his assigned parking spot. After driving to the ghetto, arguing with both the towing people and his landlord, I still had to pay $193.30 in towing fees. Now I'm broke, bummed, and I just want to spend the rest of the day watching Bridesmaids and Mean Girls and gorging on some pizza. It be awesome if someone could help me out today, I'll pay it forward one day! Peace out!
