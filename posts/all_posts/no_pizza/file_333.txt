I'm not asking for pizza for myself (I'm vegan) but for my friend. He lives in LA (I live on the east coast) and has fallen on hard times. He's going to school and will graduate in December, but was laid off a couple of months ago and will soon be evicted. I don't really have any expendable income at the moment. Maybe some internet kindness can lift his spirits. Thank you.
