So tomorrow I hit 19 (3/3/1993) and I'm having a party with a few friends of mine the day after. Unfortunately, I'm a college student and all my friends are in about the same situation. What I'm getting at is, we have no cash to do anything on Sunday. If a fellow Redditor were to hook us up with a pizza then I would go through their comments and upvote everything they've ever posted. What say you?
