As the title suggests, I've got nothing in my home until tomorrow. My parents are out (small holiday like thing) and unfortunately my brother devoured all of the food in my house. This is a quick throwaway to avoid my friends whom all seem to stalk my history on Reddit. I'll be more than willing to provide my actual Reddit account in PM.


Appreciate you taking the time to read this
