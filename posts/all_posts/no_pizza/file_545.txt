My school is opened these last two days (Monday and Tuesday) for finals even though a lot of people had most of theirs last week. My friend and I have an exam on Tuesday, so we haven't been able to go home early. But what I don't get is why all the food shut down without a prior notice. I've been living on meal swipes this semester, but now their useless and I'm broke, so no going out to eat. I just need a pizzaaaa.
