Today we are donating to a GREAT cause! The East Washington Day Shelter, a shelter for the homeless, collected hot pizzas from us to serve their guests. The shelter only serves from 12-2pm and is serving roughly 75 people!

There's still more that's needing. Because of that we'll be donating today, tomorrow, and Friday. We are only donating 5 a day - and that's where YOU COME IN!

If you're interested in donating a pizza to the shelter tomorrow or Friday please call our Willy St location (608-258-2000) before 12pm to sponsor a donation. It's getting cold out and there's nothing more needed than warm food. Please help us support this shelter!
