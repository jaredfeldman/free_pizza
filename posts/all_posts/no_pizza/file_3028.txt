As the title says, it's been a rough month for my family for a number of reasons financial troubles being on the top of the list. My reason for posting is that groceries have been pretty sparce for the past week or so. The kids, wife and I have been had our fill of bland pastas and such. Payday is in less than a week and the generosity of friends and family in addition to picking up odd jobs here and there are the only things that have gotten us through this month.

Long story short, a pizza sounds unbelievably awesome right about now, even more so when imagine the how excited the kids would be after a week of serving dinner to sad face and disappointed grumbles.
