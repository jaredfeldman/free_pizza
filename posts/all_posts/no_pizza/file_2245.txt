I've been having one heck of a time this month. First I came down with a really bad bug and missed work (Full-time student so I only work a couple nights a week) Then my water pump started leaking on my car. I spent every penny to my name on a replacement and managed to put the car back together without any left over bolts. Then last monday the car decided that I did not need a transmission that works. So I'm stranded on foot waiting for income taxes to come in so I can fix/replace the car. 

I'm buried in homework at the moment and sitting here trying to finish a project thats worth half of my grade. A hot pizza would make the night much more enjoyable. 

Thanks in advance
