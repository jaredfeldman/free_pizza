I just moved back to Brooklyn and slept on a living room couch for the past month. I am currently subletting an apartment but don't have a full time job. That means rent comes before food. I worked from 4pm on sunday to 6am this morning doing labor at the metropolitan museum and didn't eat during that time. Please help and when I am capable I will pay it forward. Thanks.
