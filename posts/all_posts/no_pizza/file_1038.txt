just left PA to move to new york to couch surf with a friend until next month when my VA check comes in so i have enough money to get a studio apt with 1st months rent and security deposit due , i have zero funds im a disabled vet and had 3 surgical proceedures done last week , i sure would love a warm pizza but most of all i want to share it with my friend to in some way do something nice for her to repay in some small way the kindness and generosity she gave me 
     thanks , Louie
