I don't have a canvas long enough to paint a vivid picture of my sob story, so I won't. Instead, I devised a few riddles for you to have fun with. If you enjoy the challenge they present maybe you'll reward me with a gift card for my cleverness? It never hurts to try. So here you go, a few riddles to toy around with while you debate whether or not I deserve a hot meal today.

1.) What's 4 inches long but can house all of your buds?

2.) If I press hard enough I might strike a face that makes me a wealthier man. What am I?

3.) How many links are in the chain when it clinks?

4.) Right now may not seem like spring at all, but I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow, and then all of these will belong to you.

5.) I had a cat I named him Earl. I had a fish I named him Pearl. But what should I name my bird of prey?

I hope you enjoyed my little challenge of wits, I'll post the answers later regardless of whether or not I receive a gift card. So best of luck and see how many you can get right. And if you feel like helping a guy a bit down on his luck eat tonight feel free to message me or post below. 

Thanks again and remember, a mind is a terrible thing to waste, but it's even more terrible to waste a mind.
