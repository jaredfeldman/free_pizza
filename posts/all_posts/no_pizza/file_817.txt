id really like to have a nice pizza dinner with my family. its been a long time. we had our house destroyed by the hurricane Irene. its still standing but not livable and were told we have to rebuild it. me, my husband and our four kids are staying with my sister. its really hard cuz we were struggling before (i was laid off a few mo ago) and now its just scary sometimes. im going to career centers and applying for jobs, but there just arent any. my husband takes OT when its available. our church is helping us but there are others who need much more and i dont want to take away from them.

we have food on the table. its usually not much more than boiled chicken and instant potatos but were managing. a pizza dinner would be an incredible treat. even my teen and pre-teen would sit down with us if there was pizza! if anyone can help, id be so happy.

thank you
