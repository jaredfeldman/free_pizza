Got roughly $6,000 on 4 cards over the years from touring in various bands, school, medical stuff, and luxury purchases. Currently living in my friends living room and I have 81 cents in my bank account. I've been applying for work like crazy but nothing has come up for me yet. Looking for a repreave from the now nightly Top Ramen dinner.
