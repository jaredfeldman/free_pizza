My girlfriend and I live together and usually rely on her pell grant money to get us through the semester. Unfortunately, this year, we were both denied financial aid. Luckily a member of her family took out a loan so she could go to school. I cannot. So here we are, knowing our paychecks are going to pay our late rent instead of food, which we have run out of. Tomorrow i plan to go sell some things to the pawn shop to get us through for a while. But we haven't eaten today. I know this is asking for a lot. But I don't see us being able to eat for at least another two days. Could someone help us out? Thank you for reading this.
