So, tonight I'm staying in and writing a term paper for the next few days. It's on N. Scott Momaday's "House Made of Dawn" if you're curious. I would appreciate some brain food. :) 

EDIT: And to make it fun, how about we make it one pepperoni and one with any combination of toppings. Your choice! (Except please no pineapple or fish.)
