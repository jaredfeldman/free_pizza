Throwaway account, I have friends that are redditors

Recently my wife lost her job, we have too many bills, my mother passed away due to diabetes and now I just got in a crash recently. I have a lot of bills but not enough money and my family suffers for that. A pizza would really help us cope with all this bs that life is throwing our way. I have a beautiful wife and a really awesome son who I love very much. I know begging is the last thing people want to do but I am at that level. I don't know what to do and I have barely enough money to cover all of this. I would really appreciate it if someone would gift us a pizza and I'm sure so would my family. The chances of me getting one are low but its still worth a try. God bless you for reading this and thank you. If by some miracle someone gifts us one then I would gladly repay the favor when I get back on my feet.
