Hey RAoP,

My situation is that I just finished a term in AmeriCorps (http://www.reddit.com/r/americorps) now I'm looking for work and picked up a class to teach at a college, but it doesn't even cover my rent so I'm still looking for a full-time job.

I ran out of food this month because I was sharing my food stamps with another AmeriCorps to tide him over (he's a wiry guy that ate like a horse, and I'm just a wee 120 lb gal that doesn't need that much, so it made sense at the time).  I'm down to 5 packets of ramen, but new funds come in on the 5th so I really just would like to get through this weekend and also feel a bit less depressed while job hunting and lesson planning.  If you could please send me a pizza, it would make my night!

Thank you.  Hopefully someday soon I'll be the one sending out the pizza.
