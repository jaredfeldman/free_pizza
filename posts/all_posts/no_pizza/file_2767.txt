Hi! I just recently moved across the US to Seattle. My previous jobs had always provided me with room and board, but unfortunately it was deducted from our paychecks, not really leaving us with a whole lot left over. I moved to Seattle a month ago, and thankfully have a great group of friends here that are more than generous with their couches until I get up on my feet. I have a job, but not one that can afford me pizza. And I love pizza. Thanks!
