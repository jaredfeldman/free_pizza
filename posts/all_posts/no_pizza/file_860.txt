I'm sure this sub-reddit gets this kind of story a lot, but I'm a university student with about forty dollars to my name until Christmas studying for finals season that starts on Saturday. 

I've also been looking for a job for the last month and a half to no avail, a pizza would really brighten my mood right now. 

Thanks for hearing me out.
