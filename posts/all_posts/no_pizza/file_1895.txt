My landlord double-leased the apartment we were staying in, resulting in them showing up last Thursday morning to kick us out. We disputed and proved our lease wasn't until up until the 31st of August, but they did everything in their power to get us out early. They're supposed to refund our unused rent and give us a little extra, but there's no telling when we'll see that check. We've spent every dime we have moving into a new place; deposit, first and last month's rent, getting utilities turned on, etc. really adds up. We're looking at an empty pantry and totally bummed. If someone could get us a pizza for tonight we'd be incredibly grateful.
