Money is being wired to me as we speak, but it looks like it won't be here until tomorrow. My fridge will be empty for at least another day... Will write a true sob story, short story, persuasive essay, one-on-one written RP, play any of the co-op games on my Steam, draw anything to the best of my abilities, or do pretty much anything reasonable in return for a pizza.

Request will expire tomorrow at 10am Eastern because I will no longer require help and I refuse to accept pizza when I am capable of purchasing it myself.

I'm into equivalent exchange and karma, and I will put pizza in a less fortunate redditor's mouth if helped.
