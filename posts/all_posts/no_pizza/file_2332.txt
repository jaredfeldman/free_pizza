Here's the story I have a sick three year old and was up all night. I am tired, my house is a disaster, and I feel lazy. We live on a limited income so can't afford to spend extra on pizza especially with school starting next week and trying to get kids ready with supplies, clothes, fees, and all the crap. I would love a pizza. If anyone has it in their heart to help me out we have Papa Johns, Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Little Ceasers opened yesterday.
