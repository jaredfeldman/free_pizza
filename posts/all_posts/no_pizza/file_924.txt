I just recently moved to a new town (first time on my own). I have tried very hard to get a job doing anything. I am a very hard worker but, no one seems to care about that anymore. I will probably have to move back home because my parents won't help me with anything. Im 19 and going to school for film and photography. I have heard Reddit was a very friendly community. I have posted stuff before but am still kinda new to this. Any help will be greatly appreciated and I will somehow try to pay it forward. Thank you all.

EDIT:Round Rock, TX
