Got paid last week and had to ante up everything for the end of the month billing cycle. Help a redditor enjoy watching some great eSports action? The GSL Finals are tonight / tomorrow morning (05:10 EDT) and I'm going to be up all night. Would love to have chow down on some pizza for the occasion. 

Looking to pay it forward as soon as I get paid again, in another 2 weeks.
