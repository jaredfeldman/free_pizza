Well to cut to the chase I am living with HCM (hypertrophic cardiomyapthy) and I have been having some trouble breathing lately.  Being uninsured, I go to the urgent care center and the doc tells me that I suffered a mild heart attack sometime last week.  It hit me kind of rough because I haven't had an episode in years and I've been really healthy. All my family is 8+ hours away and to be honest it feels good to just tell someone in general.  

Anything reassuring would really boost my spirits/confidence in the matter if only an 'it's going to be ok.'  Thanks in advance and once my spirits pick up, I promise to pay it forward.
