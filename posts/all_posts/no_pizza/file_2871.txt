My wife and kids, and mother in law left this morning to Washington state to visit her family she hasn't seen in about 20 years.. We saved up for airfare and money to spend while they were there.. I just got a new job about 2 moths ago. We were drowning in debt but with this job, are afloat again. well, we bought me groceries for my stay at home this week (ramen, easy mac, hambuger helper) so she could have as much money that was left for them ($300) to spend while they were there. All i would like is a half meat lovers half pepperoni and jalapeno on thin crust from pizza hut. i have no $ to spend until i get paid next week on the 20th. If you can help out, thank you. If not, help someone more needy. Ya'll have a good one.
