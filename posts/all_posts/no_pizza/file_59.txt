I would like to request someone to send a pizza to my mom. She and my dad divocred (it was final las Friday) she has been having a rough time and could use some encouragement! It would be a blessing to not have to worry about dinner for one night for her, my sister, and brother. 

I know alot of people will wonder why don't I do it myself... well I don't have the money for that. My husband and I are currently living paycheck to paycheck like many others, currently only on my income, due to layoffs.

Thanks!

P.S. to all of those out there that are able to give and help those in need and encourage people- you are all blessings from heaven!! It's so great to see that gracious people still exist in the world.
