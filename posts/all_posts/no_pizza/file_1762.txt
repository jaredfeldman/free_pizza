I've been laid off since June and while my wife makes enough to keep us (us and two boys) afloat; we've had to cut way back and we've been living without any extras. Great news is she just got a raise, which she'll get on her next pay check. RAoP'ers, would anyone care to help us into this home stretch with one crazy night of cheesy goodness? Thanks for listening.
