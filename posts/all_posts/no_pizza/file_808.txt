So, yeah, as the title reads, I've had one hell of a week.  I had a job as a clerical assistant in the East Hartford area for about 2 months, essentially doing scrub work, and thought everything was going well, until out of the blue on Tuesday, they fired me without a real reason.  I've since been on a few job interviews, but this economy is killing everything up here, and I'm getting scared.

As a cherry on top of my already wonderful week, my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years left me, saying we've been moving in separate directions for some time now.  I think this is code for she's been fucking everyone in town behind my back, but who knows.

So Reddit, I come to you on my knees, looking for a little help.  I know how sad and pathetic it sounds, but a pizza would help erase the memory of this week, but I just don't have the means to go out and buy one now, since I'm unemployed, paying both sides of my rent, utilities and misc. expenses.
