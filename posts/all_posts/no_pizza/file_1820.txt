My best friend, who I haven't seen in THREE MONTHS!!!, came into town last night to celebrate for her 23rd birthday! Being it was my duty to show her a good time last night that she would never remember (until the pics make it Facebook...mission blackout accomplished) it is my duty to pamper her and take care of her today....and she would LOVE some pizza to cure her hangover!!! :-) 

Sincerely,
Extremely hungover yet amazing best friend ;-)
