As the title says, there isn't much going on here in Cary this Sunday for me. If you've ever been bored to the point of counting the squares on your ceiling, please consider me. When I say there's nothing going on, I truly mean there is nothing going on. A yummy, cheesy pepperoni pizza would definitely break the monotony that is this very boring Sunday. Thank you.
