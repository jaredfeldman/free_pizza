I spend a lot of time between NYC and Washington, DC. Spring break is officially started and my usual arrangements are all in a worst case scenario kinda way, exhausted. My parents are out of the country, my fianc√© is on a ship, phoneless and I am here very hungry. Ask me anything you want to verify!
