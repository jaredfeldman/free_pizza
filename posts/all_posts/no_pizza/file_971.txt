Dear Reddit, i posted earlier but i didnt put request in the title so it was removed. Here is my second attempt. So, today i finally met my first in person redditor and i have to say, it was amazing. (ive been a lurker since the whole Digg v4 fiasco, but i decided to make an account a few days ago so i can be somebody in this community for once. Anyway, she told me about this subreddit where if youre hungry, short on cash, or are willing to meet some sort of requirement, someone will order you a pizza. So heres my shot. Basically im pretty broke at the moment. I live with a roommate but i really dont want to go through her fridge and be "that guy" who eats what he wants even if it isnt his. I make minimum wage (30hrs a wekk) in my state but luckily i work about 3 miles away so i dont spend much on fuel. I have 3 children and i was divorced almost a year ago. About half my monthly income goes to child support and random bills (i was an idiot and got a title loan at a desperate time in my life and i still have to pay a pretty hefty monthly payment for a few more months. My state says i make too much to receive food stamps so i have to pay for all my food with cash and also food for when i get my children on the weekends (i want to make sure they have 3 good healthy meals a day when theyre here). so heres where i ask, Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, will you please buy me some pizza, im sure it will be left overs and help me out through out the week until im payed on friday. im willing to do whatever tasks im needed to earn this pizza. I love Reddit and all it stands for, especially subreddits like these (assistance, suicidewatch) I live in Idaho if that helps any fellow Idahoan Redditors. Thanks Reddit.
