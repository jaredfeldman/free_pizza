Hello!!! 

I've heard great things about this subreddit and was hoping someone would help me out. 

Had my hours cut at work, got paid last week only to spend it all by sunday catching up on bills.  Had to pay for car insurance or else my license would have been suspended ( almost reached day 30)  because I wasn't made aware I lost my insurance ( parents always took care of it). And Now the car's engine won't even kick over. 

Stomach is growling and I have nothing but dry cereal ( which is something some people can't say I know. )  So I'm hoping one of you kind people will help me fill my belly. 

I promise to pay it forward x2 this pay check (1st of February) and will make sure my benefactor receives confirmation if desired. 

Please and Thank you you magnificent internet type people.
