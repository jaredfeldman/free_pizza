Hey guys, don't have much to say. College student, aspiring comedian. Don't have a lot of money flowing at the moment but today is Monday Madness in Athens (3.99 medium 1-topping) and I could really use some food for the week. Anyone out there wanna help a brother out, just throwing it out there. Will be checking this throughout the day. Promise I will do the same once I get paid for a show (which is rare but I am hoping someone trusts me). That is all.
