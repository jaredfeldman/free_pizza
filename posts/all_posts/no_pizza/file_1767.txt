Hey all. I recently have gone completely broke. .90 cents to my name. I recently applied to graduate schools, and paid rent as well, so I have nothing to my name until next week, when I get paid. If anyone out there can help me out, I would immensely appreciate it, and would return the favor after next Friday (1/11/13).

Thanks.
