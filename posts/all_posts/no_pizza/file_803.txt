So, here is my story. I am a 19 year old college student that has been trying to get various jobs for 5 years now. My town is at a low point for a while and even getting hired at McDonalds is a competition between young kids and elders. This, however, is beside the point.

I want to surprise my dad with his favorite Large Cheese Pizza from Pizza Hut. I want to do this because he recently quit smoking. This is pretty big as my family as a huge history of addiction. He quit drinking 2 years ago after 3 years of nearly killing himself. He has liver cirrhosis and if he cannot get a transplant within 6 years, he is guaranteed to die. So, I want to reward him for cleaning himself up and being strong for the rest of our family. If someone can help, that would be great. I have seen some awesome things done here, and you are all fantastic.

Thank you
