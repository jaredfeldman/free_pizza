I live in Tucson, AZ, and came out of work to find a small tree on the hood of my car after this afternoon's lovely storm. Fixing this is going to be the rest of my money until payday on Friday, and I'm just hoping that there's someone out there thinking about passing on a pizza. I'm a big believer in karma, and I'm hoping that she's going to be kind to me after the past few weeks of absolute shit. UGH. Right before my vacation, too :(
