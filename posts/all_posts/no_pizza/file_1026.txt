Hey.. Just lost my job due to the owners going bankrupt. Not only that but we're not receiving our last paychecks as far as I know. I just spent 1.5 weeks working for money I may not receive. 

Five minutes ago I just paid my bills.. I now have $1.04 to my name now. If someone would care to simply be awesome I'd love to eat today.
