My family is grieving now over the loss of our dog, Ryan. My kids are 
handling this as best as they can, but more than anything we could really all use a hug right now. 

About two weeks ago, I came home to find Ryan walking into the wall. I picked him up to see if he would recognize me, but he wasn't his playful self. I rushed him to the vets, where he was kept overnight. The next evening I got the news that he needed to undergo liver shunt surgery. His surgery was scheduled for today, but he passed away overnight.

This little angel went through many bouts of going to the vets. Some 
days he was bouncing around and playful, and some days he wouldn't do much of anything. I didn't think he could have been suffering from 
something so serious.

I'm doing my best to be strong for my children, but Ryan was like one of the children. I haven't been able to do much of anything today, and I'm hoping someone out there would be willing to buy dinner for my family tonight. Outside of struggling to pay bills, we've now lost a member of our family.
