I am a new college student and have been having a real hard time these first few weeks with financial aid and as a result i am not on a meal plan this year.  Because of this i have to buy all of my own food which is a problem because i have very little money to begin with.  Ive been having 1 ramen cup a day and thats all i have eaten in 4-5 days.  Im really hungry and a friend recommended this subreddit.  Please Help.
