Recently my basement apartment was completely flooded. It took all my sheets and towels to dry the place out. So I spent the day and, what to me, is a fortune at the coin laundry. So there was no money for groceries. Today I finished off the last food, and my monthly stipend does not arrive until the day after tomorrow. I could really use a pizza.
