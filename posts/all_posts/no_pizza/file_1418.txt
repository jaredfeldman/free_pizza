Hi fellow pizza lovers. I stumbled across this subreddit at work today, and holy wow. This is the best thing I've seen in awhile.
My boyfriend and I are both government workers who just bought a house. A house, you say! Why, you are a plethora of good tidings and joy! Well, while that is true, we are also supremely poor because of it. We've been saving for a long time to acquire this house, and while it rules, we haven't purchased anything awesome for a long, long time (and will continue on this path until either magic or raises happen. I, personally, have my eyes on magic). Spaghetti (cheapest. food. ever. still delicious. how does it happen?) every night and PB &amp; J every afternoon. I'm not complaining. Definitely used to it at this point. We just miss pizza! We miss it so!
Regardless of the outcome of this request, I still think this is the coolest idea in the world, and hope that many might profit from its supreme and magnanimous awesomeness. Oh yeah! We're in Pittsburgh, PA
