I just switched to direct deposit and apparently it won't clear until after midnight tonight :(  My car broke down last week so I had to shell out a ton of money on it and was really counting on my pay to be here. I've never struggled to feed my daughter and I'm feeling awful and like a bad mother right now so I told my friend and she told me she'd help if she had the cash but recommended that I ask you guys. I've never really used reddit before but she swears I'm going to be addicted lol. Anyhow, I'll be on here for at least the next several hours while I'm at my desk, hoping for an answer! Here's a pic of me and my daughter : http://postimage.org/image/e4ux9nzet/
