hello Random acts of pizza! im a poor college student and just came across this subreddit, im going to valencia community college near UCF in orlando and i was hoping to eat a warm pizza tonight. Theres not much in my pantry, a couple boxes of ramen and thats about it.

I was a video game tester for 3 years for Electronic Arts but got laid off 7-8 months ago and havent been able to find a job since. If you have any questions about being a video game tester id be happy to answer them for you, i know it interests a lot of people

thank you in advance!
