Hello RAoP. I simply don't have money left after paying bills this month. I finished off the last of the rice earlier today and there is literally nothing left in the kitchen to eat. I ran out of options and am starting to get really hungry. If anyone could please help me out I would be extremely grateful and willing to do anything i can to repay you! Thanks.
