I'm hanging out with my friends and we are about the watch a Batman movie marathon before we go see the Dark Night Rises again tomorrow. But my parents left me without any food in my house. I've given them drinks, but i assume we are going to get pretty hungry soon.

I'll draw a picture of batman as a reward! Thanks.
