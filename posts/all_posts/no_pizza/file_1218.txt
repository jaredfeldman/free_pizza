Hello.
i'm an artist out of washington state. i make art on postal stickers, screenprints, paper (hand-drawn), and digital photoshopery. 

I'm willing to exchange pizza for art. 

20bux worth of dominos pizza gets you:
8 postal stickers
1 screen print or 1 logo(this one may come later)
4 hand drawn pieces (i use crayon and sharpie like a champ).

more than 20 bux in pizza=more art

whether you like the art or not is not up for me. if you like to sample my damn fine works, you may find them at drobotart.com

thanks cool people.
