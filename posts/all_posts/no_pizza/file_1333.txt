It took me some time to figure out where to make this post. My friend Mary has received pizza from here, and told me this is where I should post. I worked with her husband at a distribution center that has closed down, and I am at the point between choosing buying medicine and buying food. I was diagnosed with CHF congestive heart failure and underwent triple bypass surgery last year. Going without my medication is not an option and I'm willing to provide pictures of my empty and nearly empty pill bottles. My son is going to help me with food when he gets paid on the 17th, but I really can't go another night without eating.
