Hi... I am new to this, so I hope I am doing it right. I live in central FL. My husband and I have 3 young children. My husband is a local truck driver and I am a stay-at-home mom. A couple months ago our roof decided to start leaking, right in to our bedroom. Insurance isn't covering it because the roof is old. We are trying to save to repair the roof and replace the drywall that was damaged. Since that time, things have continued to spiral downward. I don't want to be long winded, but it has gone so far that we have had to apply for foodstamps and medicaid because I have 2 have surgery and a diagnostic procedure to rule out cervical cancer. My husband's wages have been cut because the runs just aren't there. We are struggling and the only way that we have had any food for the past couple of weeks is because of my parents. I have been looking for a job, but I have had no success. We are even having to sell our electronics on craigslist to try and get some money to survive. It has been very stressful and frustrating for us and I know our kids can tell that something is wrong. I was hoping that someone might be willing to give us just one bright spot in this dark time. Thanks for taking the time to read all of this. Blessings to you all. :0)
