Dreamin' of a Pizza, waiting for a locksmith.

It's been a long day. A long groovy day, save for a moment of brilliance wherein I bravely locked my keys securely away in my vehicle. I was startled by a child with a airsoft pain inflictor; instinct demanded I slam the door shut and turn to face the culprit. I am a smart, brave man.

Anyway, evening plans are kinda shot now. I'm chilling out, waiting for a locksmith, hoping it won't eradicate the funds I need to float on blissfully towards that next paycheck. 

If I am blessed by pizza, I'll happily pay it forward.
If not, I may be forced to hunt down and devour that small child.
