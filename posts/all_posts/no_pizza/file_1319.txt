I just bailed a childhood friend out of jail today. He had been getting mixed up in drugs, and honestly, I hadn't spoken to him in about a year. But I never stopped caring about him. He got pulled over, and cops found a bag of weed. He got arrested and no one else, even his family, came to get him out. Cost me around $1000 to release him... Im dry with money now and could use a a pizza... I of course would pass along the generosity
