Girlfriend's out of town for the weekend, but even if she were here her car's busted, and we're both broke. So i'm just sitting here on Reddit, depressed and hungry. Pizza places don't open for a little bit here but if someone could help me out with a pie and a 2 liter you'd be my hero.

Edit: I'm an idiot and totally spaced on the location. Oh well. If anyone sees this and wants to take pity, i'm in Tempe AZ. I'd edit the title but dunno how.
