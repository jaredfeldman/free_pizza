My kids are home for the summer, and I have NOTHING good to cook tonight. Payday is a few days away and (despite my epic culinary skills) I can't muster up anything tasty. Last night I tried to make a spicy noodle dish with broccoli that caused the kids not speak to me for the rest of the evening. Please help me reclaim my position as a cool mom. The kids have different tastes, but a nice pepperoni pizza would do the trick. Thank you for considering me and the little ones.
