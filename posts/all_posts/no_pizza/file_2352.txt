So here is my story. I am 21 years of age and have studied music at the University of Arkansas for 2 and a half years. Last sememster I Decided to change majors and it cost me so much in scholarships that I cannot afford school Anylonger. I figured I would work for a semester, maybe a year, then go back to school and keep moving forward. Well I work at a video game store and I love it. The one problem is that I am having to PAyfor things that I usually didn't have to before. So while struggling I decided to consider the military. I did a lot of research and am now deciding between the Marines and the Army. I want to join the Marines but I am keeping my options open until I get as much info as I can. I am going to be moving back in with my parents next month in order to try to save some money but until then I have been living off of granola bars and the occasional ramen. I've had to sell my video games and musical instruments to pay rent and such and have to pay for gas in change most if the time. Anyways thank you for your time. 

TL;DR: struggling hungry dude moving in with parents in order to survive till joining the military.
