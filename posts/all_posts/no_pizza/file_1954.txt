A delivery driver was shot and killed while approaching someone stealing from coworkers cars: http://www.wthr.com/story/15957703/pizza-delivery-driver-shot-in-bloomington 
I've never been on this subreddit before but I figured this was appropriate to link, and since that location is offering all proceeds to go to the family of the deceased( http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pizza-X/82904137667 ) I figured RAoP might be interested. There is nothing in it for me: I do not know the individual/family of the deceased, but I am from Bloomington and felt like outreach might be appreciated by his surviving family.
