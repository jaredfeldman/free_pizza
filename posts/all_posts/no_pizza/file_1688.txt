Hey there. I want to thank you in advanced for reading this post and commenting. :) I appreciate it.


I would love a stranger to make my week with a pizza :)

My baby is sick with a cough cold and fever, she has been having horribal nights meaning I haven't gotten much sleep for a few nights. I would love a warm hot pizza so I could get a break from cooking and giving her medicen every four hours.

I am willing to send a handwritten note or take a picture of the box with a special message for you. :)


xoxo
