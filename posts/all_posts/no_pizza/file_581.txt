Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I have been having such a terrible month. My parents don't do anything, they don't clean, they don't cook, they just yell and yell. I've always put on a plastic smile, but something snapped. I ended up crying to my friends house in the rain, and I was taken to the hospital.

I ended up staying at the psych ward for nine days, the doctors wanted to keep an eye on me. They prescribed some anti depressants, but my parents refused, saying that they don't think the medicine will work!

Now I came back to my house, nothing really changed. The only thing we eat is the food my brother and I cook, rice and spaghetti, and the terrible foods my mom gets from the restaurant she works at.

I'm not begging for a pizza, but I really would like one? I'll try to pay back if I can, I just need some comfort food, I haven't had any pizza for a long time, and it would really help me cope with all of this.
