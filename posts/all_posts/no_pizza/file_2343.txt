Hi everyone,

I have heard of this place and been here before, this is the first time I am posting. As of yesterday I am officially out of food and money. I've been living on Nutri-grain bars for the past month that I had managed to purchase from the store I work at (If they're expired, an employee can purchase them for 75% discount + the normal 10% employee discount, so I jumped on em) however now I am completely out. 

I will get paid this Friday, but that paycheck will almost entirely go to bills minus the amount of money I need to feed myself. I'm not going to exaggerated and claim that my situation is dire (it IS Thursday and I only have to hold out until tomorrow) because there probably is someone out there who needs it more than I do. However, if there is a kind stranger out there who has the means and decides to reward me, I would be so much in their debt.

Happy Valentines Day Reddit, and thank you.
