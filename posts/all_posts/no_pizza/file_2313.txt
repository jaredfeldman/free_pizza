I've been working door to door installing those TV energy saver things, and we get paid per unit as a sub contractor. My boss just decided that he isn't going to pay me. I'm owed about $1500, and there are 2 others in the same boat.

The last of my money I spent on rice and potatoes. It's hard to believe, but I have literally not spent any money in 3 weeks! I'm waiting on my tax return, and that day can't come soon enough. If you have any questions, I have some pretty hilarious stories about going door to door in rural Victoria, the job itself was pretty awesome. 

Oh, and cheers to Vodafone who gave me free phone credit so I could get my tax submitted. Very cool of them. If you're kind enough to donate a pizza, I'd be very grateful and would obviously pay it forward. :)
