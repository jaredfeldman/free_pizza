I was stupidly laid off of my last job and have been without work for the past two months. I could definitely go for a pizza. In return I'll send you something precious of your choosing.


**EDIT:** I live in Kansas. Close friends with the Kents. Haven't seen Clark around lately. Would love a pizza instead.
