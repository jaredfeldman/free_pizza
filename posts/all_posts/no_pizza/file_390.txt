A friend and I are students at Georgia Tech and we have an important Calculus 2 midterm Tuesday that is 45% of our grade and we are afraid to leave my dorm room this weekend because we might get distracted and not have time to memorize convergence tests, taylor series for power series expansions.  We normally wouldn't come to reddit, but we used up all of our dining hall meals that we can portion for the time being.  If anyone could help, I would be beyond appreciative and would try to return the favor when my pay check comes in from my lab work next wednesday.  Willing to verify etc, thanks!
