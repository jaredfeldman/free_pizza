this month was rough with a highe than planned electric bill and been paying for 20lb propane to heat our house while we wait for wood and so we had tuna and crackers for brunch... 

needless to say with the girlfriend's sister over tonight we could use a real meal but one we don't have to scrap together, something with ease might do us well. and hopefully we bounce back quick when the money rolls in. 

new to the subreddit, thanks for any help. peace :)
