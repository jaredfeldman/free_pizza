So my  gf is out of town and I've caught up all the house work so it's time for a well deserved marathon with a neighbor.  

I have used all my money towards bills so the spending money is with my gf and I would feel bad asking my neighbor for pizza since he is always broke like myself.  Just wanted to see if anyone would be so kind to hook  us up with  a pizza or 2.

O and don't think  we are skipping  The Hobbit!
