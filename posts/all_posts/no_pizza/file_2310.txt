HERE IS THE STORY! 

So, I'm a broke, recently unemployed college student dealing with some stress. 

I did something i've never done before, and asked for a Pizza. 

And then I had second thoughts, because I felt really horrible asking for a pizza when there are people out there with REAL problems. So I deleted my post. 

Then, an amazing redditor Pizza'd me anyways, So I am redoing this post so that the proper flair can be assigned. 

Thank you, Lordelf, I will repay your kindness as soon as I am able to.
