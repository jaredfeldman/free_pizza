I have just about zero in the way of extra cash, recently shelled out a bunch to move, but cooking just seems like the most daunting task in the world right now with the kiddo so miserable.

I just need me a bacon and pineapple pizza to curl up with on the couch while I nurse the baby into a milk coma.
