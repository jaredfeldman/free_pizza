Hey all, I just had a root canal yesterday and I don't feel like cooking the left over veggies. With rent, I am zeroed to only 50 cents in the bank. I just started a new job which takes 4 weeks to receive my first pay check. I've been relying on free food at work, vegetables and potatoes (we have a farm share at work). If you can help that will be great.
