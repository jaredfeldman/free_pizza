I live on a very tight budget and the ends just didn't meet this month.  A pizza and the bit of ramen and rice I have left will hold me over until the end of the month.

I am currently in training at a local waffle house.  I will be cooking eventually, but I'm training on tables for now.  Unfortunately, male waiters don't make tips for squat around this area.

My last $20 (mostly quarters) is to be used to drive from Jackson, to Vicksburg, and back so I can visit my dad for Thanksgiving.
