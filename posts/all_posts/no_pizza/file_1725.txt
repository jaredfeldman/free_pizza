Big economy issues. I haven't eaten more than a couple nectarines since Thursday, and there's not much to eat in this house. I've got three little siblings with mental disabilities whom I would like to feed before myself, so...anything edible usually goes to them first. Anyway, yep, if you need any more info I can provide it.
