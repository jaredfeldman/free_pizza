Alright Reddit, I'll be straight. I'm not super desperate for food. If someone else says they're on their last legs and need a pie, go take care of them first. By the time I get paid I will definitely not be starving or any such thing. But a man can only sustain on 20 cent ramen for so long before he goes crazy.

Money's Friday. You do me a solid on this, Reddit, and I'll soon reciprocate with a delicious start to your weekend.

E-gifts would be preferred (if I am allowed to say?). THANKS TTYL.
