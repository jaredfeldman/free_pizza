Is anyone out there kind enough to help me out? I started a new job Monday (in this day and age, I consider this a win) but won't get paid until the 15th. Spent all my graduation money on the deposit for my apartment near work. I am hungry and can show my pathetic empty fridge and equally pathetic bank account with $1.97 in it. Just throwing this out there if anyone has the heart to help a dude out. If so, I promise to help out another in need on the 15th when I receive my paycheck. Thanks for reading anyway.
