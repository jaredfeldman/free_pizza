This May I got pneumonia and ended up in the hospital for 4 days because my immune system wouldn't kick in and fight the infection in my lungs.  Fast forward a few months and I am in the college of my dreams, but my immune system has taken a pot shot at me again.  First it was an ear infection in week 2 of Fall Quarter, now it is the flu.  I've missed so much class I may have to go on medical leave. 

My story is long and messy - my life really exploded this spring/summer, which is why I am a 30 year old living in the college dorms. *facepalm* I'd be glad to share more of the story if you'd like, but in the meantime it would be great to have some food other than the Easy Mac, stale tortilla chips and soda I've been living on since getting sick.  Maybe something a little better would help me get well?  I can only hope!  Thanks in advance, Reddit :)
