Basically I ran out of money in my school checking account and my personal checking account my debit card has expired so as of Tuesday im waiting 10-14 business days for a new one. Only have like 3 cans of tuna, couple packs of ramen and like a decent amount of pb&amp;j but like 2 slices of bread left and some kraft singles. Should be enough to keep me fed until I can access my funds but a pizza this weekend would really let ration what I have left in case I have to wait a full 14 days. Tallahassee Florida, FSU student. Parents will not help (as usual) they said if I need money ill have to wait 3 weeks. You don't understand how much I would appreciate this.
