In a nutshell, i've been reading requests, offers, and comments and there are alot of nice giving people and alot of mean people; if you are mean and judgemental stop reading and go to another post. I decided to give this a try and see if I will survive...
I am the oldest of 6 children, i'm 19, and we are a family of 8. I know, BIG family. Anyways, I wouldn't have it any other way as I have enjoyed having my younger brothers and sisters to pick on but we never got or get to have pizza as a family because when my parents buy one it is never enough for all of us so I would like to have a couple of pizzas to enjoy with my family where we don't have to be reminded that we can only have one slice of pizza because WTF, who gets full with one slice. Also, my parents are not on any assistance which would be great for us but they are struggling financially.
If someone can help great, if not, thank you anyways. We do have junk food like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies but no PIZZA. Dominoes will work if anyone is interested in helping me surprise my family. Thanks
