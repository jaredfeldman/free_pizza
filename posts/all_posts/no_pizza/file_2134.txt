Just this Monday (11/5/12), in fact had an interview with McDee that went no where and on Tuesday (11/6/12), gonna be going to Stater Brothers for their open interviews, I'm getting in a terrible head space about this. 

I'd love some pizza to cheer me on or just maybe celebrate a new job at stater brothers.
