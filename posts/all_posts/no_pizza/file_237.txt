My fiance and I have eloped here after almost a month and a half of moving from the mid west. Everyone along the way has either been extremely beligerent towards us or unaccepting of the vision we have for ourselves and the world. It has been an especially trying last week as we've spent half of it stuck in first, a Florida airport, then in San Juan. We weren't even sure we were going to make it, if we'd be mugged or what. We're two attractive young (relatively) women. You can imagine the time we've had.

Anyway, we finally have a safe place to crash and would really really appreciate a big pizza, just for the two of us. 

Too bad we can't request 420. lol Have a good night and infinite gratitude to those who reply/offer.
