I moved in with my grandma in Seattle who doesn't grocery shop at all and only buys takeout for herself. I'm paying for college and work for not much money and can't afford to buy a lot of food. I ate mostly oatmeal I found in the cupboard for a week. I also got high for the first time in a few months and that's making me extra hungry. So it's a combination of actual hunger with added munchies.
