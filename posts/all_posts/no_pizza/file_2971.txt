I've never done this before and I'm not sure what to expect but this has been one hell of a week.  
I and my boyfriend are on a weird pay week, which means we won't be paid til next monday.  
All our bills are paid, so we're fine there. However, he (the boy) has been working overtime like crazy and yesterday he had a blowout of his back tire and we had to get all four of his tires replaced.  
If someone is feeling generous, I would love to feel the love.  
Thanks guys and even if no one answers my call, I've noticed how many pizzas have been gifted to people who really need it and you guys are awesome! Keep being amazing and thanks!
Oh! Before I forget, I'm in Pasadena, CA. I know location is important!  
EDIT: 8:07 and my boy still hasn't left for home from work.  
EDIT: 8:36 and he FINALLY just got off work.
