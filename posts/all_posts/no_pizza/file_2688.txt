Hey citizens of Random_Acts_of_Pizza!  NYC-based actor/ retail drone, broke (overdrafted at the moment) until paycheck deposits tomorrow.  Caught a weird head cold this week (better now!) and missed some shifts at work, had some family drama, and dealing with this awful heat and humidity. A sensible pizza could get me fed and happy until I can get paid and to the grocery store tomorrow. I can only eat so much cous cous in one weekend!

I've never posted here before - but I fully intend to "Pizza-It-Forward" when I'm back on my feet a bit more.  Happy June, everyone! 

EDIT: added some more info!
