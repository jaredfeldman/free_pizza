Was hoping one of you kind folks would be willing to help out a suddenly-depressed college kid. Just walked out of an Accounting Final that went pretty bad. On top of that, I was supposed to get my check for next term's financial aid this week, but won't be getting it until April 2. Anything at all would be amazing.
