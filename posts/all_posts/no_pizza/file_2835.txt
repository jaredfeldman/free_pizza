...Okay, we aren't *literally* starving (we have a few things to hold us over), but the only thing we have thawed out is hamburger meat, and we're going to do hamburgers tonight. However, my sister and I would love something to hold us over until then!

My mom's out right now, so a pizza to share between the two of us would be swell. &lt;3 I'm willing to go pick it up too, so you save money on the delivery!

I really don't know how to market this, sorry.

**edit**: plus, pizza just sounds really good. we're from the bay area~
