SO finally after months of working part time and interviewing I was offered my dream job.  I've come to reddit a lot the last few months looking for  advice and entertainment.  

I'm just about through my savings so the next few weeks until I get that first paycheck are going to be really really tough.  I'd love to celebrate with a pizza tonight instead of the standard issue ramen/spaghetti.  I can post a picture of something and most certainly will pay it forward once that first paycheck comes in.

THANKS GUYS 

EDIT: I live in the western subs of Philly
