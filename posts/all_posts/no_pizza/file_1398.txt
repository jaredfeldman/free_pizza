I have been suffering from pretty bad depression and social anxiety over the past 6 months. Ended up dropping out of my last semester of university and quit my job during this time. I just maxed out my credit card on a new prescription, and I am out of even credit now. The bottom line is I have no money to buy any food right now and only have a few cans of beans left. I would love to have a nice hot pizza to get me through the next few days. I am hoping this newest prescription works how it should and I am able to get out and find a job because I would love to play it forward and help out a fellow Redditor in need. I verified my email and also have another account which has a bunch of karma, I just have a few friends on that account and would be too embarrassed for them to find out about my current situation. Thanks in advance for anyone that has taken the time to read this and hope someone can help out. 

Some of the local pizza places are Pizza Pizza, Ginos Pizza, Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza. Pizza Pizza being the closest.
