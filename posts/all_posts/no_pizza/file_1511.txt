My wife doesn't know I'm doing this, but she will be home from work in an hour or so and I thought it would be nice to surprise her with pizza! A series of unfortunate circumstances (notice of losing my job, lost keys to our apartment that necessitated the services of a locksmith, and a fussy cat) happened this past week that unfortunately led to us draining our bank account.  I feel bad posting this as I'm sure there are countless others who probably need it more than we do, but I figured I would ask anyway. I hope to be on the giving end next week!
