If anyone is interested in my story here it is.
I was kicked out of my parent's home a few months ago for religious reasons and I'm struggling to make ends meet living on my own. My mormon parents don't talk to me and don't want to have anything to do with me after they found out I'm not going on my mission. I have a job and a room but my hours were weekends only last month and I'm completely broke until the end of this week when I get paid and even then, money is going to be tight for the next few months. I was not really prepared to live on my own like this (I just recently turned 20) and I'm really struggling. I'm trying to eat as little as I can to save as much money as I can and pizza would be amazing right now.
(I'm in Toronto, Ontario)
