I went out friday night for Star Trek trivia (which I lost) and I must have lost my debit card somewhere from the trivia event to my house.  I didn't leave the house at all yesterday as I had no need to since I had enough food to make myself dinner Saturday night when the intention of going grocery shopping today...however My Debit card is gone.  I've searched everywhere and it's gone.  This wouldn't be bad if my bank were open on a sunday but alas it is not.  Since I have nothing to eat today I figured I've give it a shot and ask another redditor for some help .  I can pay you back or pay it forward as early as tomorrow as soon as I can get to a bank and get a new card.

Thanks!
