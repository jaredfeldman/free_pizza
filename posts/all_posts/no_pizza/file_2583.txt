Been out of work, had a job interview today... didn't go so well. It was for a translation job basically, got there and found out the hard way that they are only seeking someone who can read Traditional Chinese fluently.

I only read Simplified Chinese. Whoops. I walked in, felt really good, but then that happened... Just feel kinda dumb. Didn't even let me speak to an interviewer or anything, threw my papers from the translation test away XD.

Can I get a pizza? I was counting on getting a free one from Domino's but they ended that promo and now I'm screwed XD. Pizza or no, any cheerful comments would be appreciated as well :)
