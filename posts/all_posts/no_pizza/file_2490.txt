I'm a homeless mother of 3 kids in Bloomington IN. My case worker told me about this page and I thought I would give it a shot. If you could help me and my kids for the night I would be very grateful. We're staying in a hotel for the night that my mom is paying for and she is letting me use her computer. I hope you'll reply. thank you so much!
