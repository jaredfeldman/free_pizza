so im broke (per usual) but this time im out of gas and spent the last few bucks on cat food... its not his fault im irresponsible w/ my money right? i tried to reach out to my wonderful friends on facebook, but as it turns out no one loves me as much as i thought they did. this is quite a sad day for me indeed. help a girl out, order me a pizza? i'd even take thai delivery... that would make this the best day ever, let me tell ya.
