Now, I'm not a poor guy. My family makes money, we live well.
However.
My family has recently been on a healthy food kick. I'm all for eating healthy, but I like to indulge every once in a while. They're not a fan of doing that. I'd go to the store and get something, but whoops no license. I'd order a pizza, but I have about ten bucks to my name and I have plans for that money. So just PM me if you want to send a pizza to a guy in central Florida.
