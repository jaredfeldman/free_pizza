I just recently relocated here from Texas to work on Master's degree at Fairmont State University and since I have to live in the dormitories here for the summer I was forced to also buy the meal plan for the summer.  It is sadly closed Friday-Sunday, and this week will be closed for Memorial day.  My brother (Fapocalypse_Now) suggested I check this out.  Thanks.
