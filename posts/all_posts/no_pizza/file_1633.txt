I'm just being random and asking for a random person to send me a pizza. My life is okay, school is going decent, and I'm not dirt poor. I would really like a pizza because I'll be home alone tonight as my roomates are going out with their girlfriends and I'd prefer not to be a third wheel. My dog would appreciate the crust. Thanks. 

Will provide picture of said dog with crust if my request is fulfilled.
