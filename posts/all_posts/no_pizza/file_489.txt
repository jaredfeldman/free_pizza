Greetings. My name is Melanie, and I'm 28 year old fighting Stage 2 Hodgkins Disease. I'm nearing the halfway point in my treatment. I go for chemotherapy every 2 weeks on a Thursday. I spend the weekend sleeping, and my appetite comes back by Monday or Tuesday.  One of the worst sides effects at that point is a nauseous taste in the back of my throat and strong tastes help me cope. Domino's Memphis BBQ Pizza has a strong taste that gives me some relief, and is also the idea balance of high protein/high calorie that my doctors want me to have. I'd really love to have that strong taste when I'm feeling the nausea. This is an ongoing post since every 2 weeks it would be helpful. Thank you for your help.
