I spent some time reading this site before I decided to join and ask and apparently it is not polite to join just to ask for a pizza but I REALLY could use one.  Im pregnant from a man who does not care about me's baby.  I guess I was just his toy till he found a new one.  My son Josh is 3.  Im still young and I know I have my whole life ahead of me but THAT life looks pretty grim right now if you ask me.  OH and to top if off my parents are drug addicts.  Now I am pretty sure a pizza is not going to help me situation but I AM hungry right now so if someone feels like being generous that would be GREAT!
