My boyfriend ended our relationship of 7 years to go back to his ex. About 6 months ago he got back in contact with his ex and I really didn't think much of it. Alot of people connect on Facebook, Reddit, etc. so I didn't assume they were doing anything other than just chatting. Turns out his "late meetings for work" were actually times where he would go out with his ex. I only found this out a week ago when I called one of his co-workers who told me they never had any late meetings. I confronted him when he got home and he told me that he had been spending time with his ex and was in love with her. He moved out three days ago and I've been unable to leave the apartment. I'm so depressed and I still love him. I've been bawling my eyes out for days just hoping he would just talk to me, but I know it's over. I could really use some comfort food and I don't have the money to buy anything. I've tried to budget rent and utilities and with just my income, I'll barely have enough for food and gas to get to work. I know I have to get out of this bed, look for a new place and get my head together. Right now, I don't have the will to do anything. I hope someone can treat me to some pizza please. This would mean the world to me. Thank you.
