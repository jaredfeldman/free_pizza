So me and my friend are stuck in our dorm while our friends are at a party that both of our ex gf's are also at. We're hoping our friend's didn't invite us cause of that reason. Either way, we're feelin a bit down, as well as sober, broke, and hungry. If any friendly Redditor would like to help us out a bit, we'll definitely return the favor to another hungry Redditor down the road. Thanks Reddit :)
