Hey everyone, this is my first time asking reddit for a pizza, or anything for that matter. I'm a 2nd year Environmental Science Major at Appalachian state university. I'm asking for a Pizza because I've been living off of Peanutbutter sandwiches for a bit and a cheesy pizza sounds good. I obviously will live without one, just thought I'd give this try because my friends can't buy me a pizza haha.

After reading other posts, I'd prefer someone who is legitimately starving get a pizza instead, I can enjoy my Peanut butter sandwiches a while longer.
