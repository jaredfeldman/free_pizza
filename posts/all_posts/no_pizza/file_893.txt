My friend has the house to himself, so we're doing a Marvel heroes movie marathon at the house. Unfortunately, due to us being poor bastards, the meager food we bought to begin with disappeared yesterday.

What's a movie marathon with no food??

**There's only 6 of us** so it's not a big group. Anything we get will be appreciated!

Please, thank you, and keep being awesome, RAOP. I'll return the favor when I get work.
