I used to work for a magazine company as a designer. There were multiple red flags that it was a really terrible place to work. My boss was nuts and employment there was like a revolving door. He fired me without cause about two months ago and since then I've been struggling a bit ands currently starting to sell possessions in order to buy food. I live in Chicago, IL and would really really appreciate a pizza... Thank you
