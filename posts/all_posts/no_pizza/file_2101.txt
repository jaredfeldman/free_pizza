LOCATION: Seattle  (Shoreline)  ((There's a pizza hut very close by))

I started going to school to get my life back on track, but unfortunately my alarm didn't go off a couple times and I lost my job.

Used up my food stamp card and it doesn't refill until the 5th of August.

Only got a couple packets of ramen left.  Normally ramen is fine, but whenever I eat them only I only seem to have a bare minimum of energy, and I have a test tomorrow... I really can't fail this class.

I've ordered pizzas for people and bought people games on Steam before, but no one's ever given me hand.

Got a job interview soon, and every time I get an interview I get the job, so money flow will happen soon and I will pay you back.
