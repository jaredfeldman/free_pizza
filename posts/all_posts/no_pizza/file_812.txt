I just want a little something to brighten the week up, and I'm getting pretty damn sick of ramen every day.

Pretty terrible week altogether, culminating in running out of gas on the highway last night with no money. Met with a few very nice strangers at a gas station a few hours later who knew a police officer that paid for a few gallons that got me home.
