So today I've had the worst day ever basically. This morning me and my girlfriend got into a huge fight, and she left me for who knows how long. Not to mention I lost my job a week ago or so. I just ran out of trees (yes i am an ent) and the entire town is dry at the moment (I live in orlando). I'm also running really low on money, and don't have any income coming in any time soon, seeing as I just lost my job. On top of all of this, my two bestfriends have been total douchebags lately, and we were supposed to go get cici's pizza later today (it's only 5 bucks) but they both bailed on me. This has been the 5th time in the past few weeks that they've ditched me, for no reason at all. Anyways, if any of you redditors would be kind enough to send a guy a pizza now, I would really appreciate it
