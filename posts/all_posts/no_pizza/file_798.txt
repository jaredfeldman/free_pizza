Hello all.

I'm looking to barter digital work for pizza.

Since there is a Domino's in town, and since they have an eGift system in place, they are my preferred pizza source. :-)

This work could be along the lines of...

    MS Office stuff

    website stuff

    digital art stuff

    digital audio stuff

    digital video stuff

    programming / scripting stuff

    tech support stuff

Basically, computer-related stuff. :-)

My guidelines are...

    nothing illegal (not looking for jailtime...)

    nothing NSFW (not looking for jailbait...)

    nothing unreasonable (imma not cloning teh Googelz for just a pizza...)

Feel free to pm with your projects, and we can go from there.

Thanks everyone.

Nom
