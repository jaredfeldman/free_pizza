So, I am having surgery Monday to hopefully end years of a painful rare kidney disease. I am sitting at home today realizing that today is really the last day I could really enjoy a great meal but I am broke.... 

I keep thinking about a week or more worth of hospital food, ok the jello will rock, and I am jonesing now for a pizza! 

I will be more than willing to pay it forward once recovered!
