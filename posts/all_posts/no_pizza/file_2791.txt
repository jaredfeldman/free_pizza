Was heading to work today when i was rear ended. Rear bumper got completely ripped off and the other driver fled the scene. Car luckily is drivable but needs some repairs[whole rear bumper :(]. Spent just about the rest of my income on ER surcharge but im free of injuries thankfully. Nerves a little rattled after all this and got the rest of the day to lay around and recover. Funds are on low until Friday and would really appreciate the help.
