Rent was due last week and it cost me my whole paycheck. I'm literally broke til Saturday morning and have absolutely nothing to eat at my apartment. I would really love some pizza to get me through these next couple of days. I would really love any help and promise to pay it forward as soon as I get my financial situation back on track. I love you guys.
