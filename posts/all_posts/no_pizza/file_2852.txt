Hi there.  I was hoping that maybe someone would be willing to donate a pizza to my SO and I.  My mother has our baby for the night and I would love to relax with some pizza and video games, but I don't get paid until Friday, and our kitchen is starting to look rather bare.  You can believe I will definitely be passing this forward when I get paid.
