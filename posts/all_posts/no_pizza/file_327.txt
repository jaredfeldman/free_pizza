Some help please? I do have more ramen and pasta. Just want a delectable pie instead with a twist on the process.

I have been here before and have made requests. My one caveat is that I can pay the willing giver back with a pizza when I get paid. In this case it will be this Friday.

However this time I want to do something different. I want to either pay it forward to a person of the givers choice with an included explanation as to why the person deserves a pie, or by giving me an explanation as to why you have decided to give to me a pie.

I want to do it this way to provide some entertainment for the sub, and so this doesn't look like just another desperate request. I look forward to your stories and reasoning.
