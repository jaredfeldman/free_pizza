Moved up here hoping to get a better job, didn't work out like that. Have a job, but it's enough to pay the bills, and that's really it. Payed rent, got cat food for the kitty, and TP. Pretty much emptied the bank account. Still looking for a better job, but until then, a hot cheesy pie would really make my day!
