Got evicted a few weeks ago due to my dad and I (we're roomates) falling upon difficult financial times. Thanks to the generosity of some friends, I've had a place to stay for the last 2 weeks.

However, things are getting really tight as I wait for my next paycheck to be deposited (the 5th). I already feel overextended with the friends who have been lodging me, and would prefer not to have to ask them for money/food as well.

If there are any redditors out there who are in a position to help, I would be extremely grateful and will do my best to reciprocate the favor. A pizza will most definitely get me through to my next paycheck and keep me afloat. Verification code / address / pics / anything else you want available upon request!

I'm very grateful to even have a place to ask for help, so thank you very, very much.
