My power was out for about 3 hours earlier this afternoon. I keep trying to watch DVD's (Twister...I mean when in Rome, right?) but as soon as I get halfway in the power either flickers on and off or stays off for an extended period of time. I don't feel up to going out for food either since I've been sick for about 3 days now and Hurricane Irene is being a bitch...

Thank you all!
