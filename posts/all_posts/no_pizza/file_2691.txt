I'll be sure to pay it forward! This month is just really hard because my roommates moved out right before rent is due and I had to buy a bunch of things to get by (they--a couple--took everything we originally split the cost of, so I have no dishes or utensils, cookware, etc.) until I find a place w/ my soon-to-be new roommates. And I don't make nearly enough at my minimum-wage job to afford rent by myself (college student!) so I already had to borrow $500 to cover part of my rent from my parents. They're really broke too.

Luckily I just got a second job and have been working my butt of at my current one, so once I'm well budgeted again, I'll be more than happy to pay the deed forward!
