Nothing super depressing, just poor timing. My car broke down two days ago, and I had to use my grocery money to fix it. I've been living on the pasta I had left, but I cooked the last of it earlier for lunch. I get paid tomorrow and would be more than willing to send pizza back to someone in thanks, but it might be nice to have a bit of dinner tonight if possible. I have a verification code ready and waiting as well, if that helps.
If someone should be so generous, I don't need anything fancy. It's just me here. A one topping large from Pizza Hut (are they still doing the large one toppings for 10 bucks?) would be perfect since PH is pretty close.
