We (myself and 4 kids) are out of food until I get paid on Friday and would love to have a pizza. I promise to pay it back right away when I get paid Friday!
 One pie will be plenty for the 5 of us and we don't need toppings, just plain is great.  We have Oizza Hut &amp; Domino's near us.
The kids  will eat breakfast &amp; lunch in school tomorrow and can share the big can of beefaroni tomorrow night. 

This really isn't as serious as it sounds, I do work full time and will have a paycheck Friday, so we will not starve to death if nobody gets us a pizza tonight.  We're kind of used to it and at least have relief on Friday!

Thanks for reading :)
