I hurt my hip and can't walk or stand long enough to go to the store/cook. Can't afford to order pizza(only delivery option in my area is Dominoes), and my GP can't fit me in until tomorrow. I feel like an old lady, can't handle the three flights up to our flat, so I'm stuck inside. Need something to pick me up!
