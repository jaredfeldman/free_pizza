My son is having some friends over because he just got out of the hospital! He had to have surgery on his arm after a fall and now he is doing better, although depressed because he has to wear a cast for the rest of the summer. He is having a party to celebrate, but me and my husband don't have much money because we had to spend a lot for the surgery. (thank you obama). If someone could please send us an egift card that could feed 7 kids and 4 adults we would be very appreciative. Thank you all for what you do on this site and god bless. I know my son will be so happy for this.
