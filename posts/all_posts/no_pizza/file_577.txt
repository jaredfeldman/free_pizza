My cousin about a week ago tried to change my oil in exchange for letting him use my car to drive to work. Since MN has pretty good Metro Transit, I use that to get to and from class every day.

Cue Friday when I finally had to use my car. Oil light is on. Check the oil. THERE IS NO OIL. He messed up the oil filter and everything leaked out. Had to spend the only money I had left (until tomorrow) fixing it.  Could use a Pizza tonight. My other option is to use the couple bucks i have to buy McDonalds, but then not be able to take metro transit and therefore miss class. 

Let me know if you want to help out! I will definitely pay it forward next week. :)
