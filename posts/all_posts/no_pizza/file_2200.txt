I'm going to try to be very clear and straightforward.  I was out of work for a few weeks and unfortunately I recently ran out of cash.  The good thing is that I started working again this week but I won't be getting paid for another week.  After losing my job I felt hopeless but now I'm hopeful that things are starting to turn around.  I would certainly appreciate it if I was able to get a pizza because my kitchen is completely empty.  As soon as I'm able to I'm going to be sure to return the favor to someone else as often as possible.  I wouldn't feel comfortable receiving it if I didn't know I would do the same for someone else.
