Hey redditors,

I'll be upfront, this is a throwaway account.  I've got a little too much pride still to let people really know how bad of a situation I'm in.

To be blunt, my life sucks right now.  My wife left me about a year ago, the woman I've been seeing is now with one of my closest friends, I just lost my job 4 months ago, and the temp work just isn't out there.

The high point of my life right now is my little boy.  He's the best thing to come out of my marriage, I would do anything in the world for him.

This is why I'm coming to you Reddit.  My wife is bringing him back tomorrow, and I would love to be able to surprise him with some pizza.  The sad fact is though, I can't afford it.  Which is why I'm coming to you guys.  

I've seen some amazing generosity on here in the past few days, and was wondering if I would be lucky enough to get some too.
