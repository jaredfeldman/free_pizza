Hi /Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, I design doom maps in my spare time[reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)  and I thought it'd be fun (and yummy!) to make a map or two for pizza. So just leave some details on a map you'd like me to make, I usually map in boom format so pretty much any source port should run it. If you have a midi in mind for me to use post it! (No mp3s please. I think boom might run ogg but I'm not sure). Also I'm a bit of a slaughter mapper, so I might go a biiiiit heavy on the mob count. I don't intend on spending more than a week on the map, so nothing too big.


And just to plug my projects a bit:

I've also done a map for Plutonia Revisited and 2 in the 1994 redux project.
