Hi guys-- I'm a college student in Atlanta, Georgia. I just finished my finals and today is my boyfriend's last day at his awesome Co-Op. I'd love to be able to make today a celebration! Regrettably, like more students, I'm flat broke. Anyone willing to help my boyfriend and I celebrate? As soon as my loan money comes in in January I'd love to return the favor :)
