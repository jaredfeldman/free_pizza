It is a dreadful rainy day in Chico, and I have no current means of dry transportation. A hurricane of an empty stomach is howling at me, and the only cure I can think of is some tasty Dominos delivery. Please help me out, and someday in the future I shall return the favor to another in need of tasty round goodness.
