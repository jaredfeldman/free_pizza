Long time lurker.... 

So..I'm 21 years old and I've been really struggling to come up with money to eat lately. I've been trying to find jobs as much as I can but I am currently a bit stuck at home because I have gout. It has affected my left foot severely and I cannot exactly leave the house or get out as much as I need to. 

Just hoping someone can help me out! I will forward the favor one day!
