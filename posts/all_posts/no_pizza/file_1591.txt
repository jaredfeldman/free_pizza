I just got into bellingham this morning, trying to find a job on a fishing boat, and ended up spending several days worth of money on the taxi/hotel so i could have a recuperating night. anyone willing to float a pizza my way? i'll most definitely pay it forward when i get setup. plus i'll love you.
