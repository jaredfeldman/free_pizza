First, this is a throw away account because I don't want my real life friends reading about this.  

My family has gotten by in the past few years through me finding odd jobs and my mothers small income from her job.  It's not much but we get by.  

The reason I'm requesting tonight is because my mom decided to take what money we had saved up to buy food for us for thanksgiving and for the next week so that she could buy alcohol, cigarettes, and lottery tickets.  I'm not sure why she did this but it leaves us with very little food for the week.  All I'm asking for is a pizza or two that could feed my family and I for the next two days until I get paid on Wed.  Thanks in advance.
