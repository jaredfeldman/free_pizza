Homeless man is a friend who just got kicked out of his house after getting out of rehab (kid has had a really rough year) and my roommates and I don't get paid till tomorrow and we have no food to eat tonight. This is my first post here so not sure what else I'm supposed to say, but if someone could help us out we would be extremely appreciative! Thanks!
