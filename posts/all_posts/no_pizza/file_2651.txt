I get paid towards the end of the week, and have been living off of Ramen and cut up hot dogs for the past three days. The money I have left in my account is going to (hopefully) buy me enough gas to get to and from work till pay day.  I'm to the point to where if I eat any more of the same stuff, I'll probably vomit.

An online friend told me about this sub-reddit so I figured I would give it a shot, and would be more than willing to lend a helping hand to someone who is in my position in the future.
