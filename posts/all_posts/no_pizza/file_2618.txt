No sad story or anything, just a broke college student (I have a part time job but most of the money goes to paying rent/food and paying down student loans early) who would love some pizza for dinner tonight. It is either the pizza or Cheerios with no milk for dinner. Help me out with either papa johns or dominos.

If someone gives me a papajohns gift card, I will use code that gives you the free pizza with an order of $10 and pay it forward in this subreddit tomorrow night!

THANK YOU!!!
