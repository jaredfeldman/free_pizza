I'm in emotional need.

But today I lost my best friend. 

My friend since fourth grade was bullied out of school in 6th, and nobody talked to him. I felt bad for him, and I stuck with him. Several years go by, and I'm still his only friend, so I convince him to come to my school, and meet my friends! So school starts, and he meets my friends, he doesn't really click with them, and decides to meet new people. A month go by, and he meets some really bad kids. Stupid kids no one else likes. Any way, I try and talk to him today, and he gives me a cold shoulder. 

When I tell him what he did wasn't cool (being an awkward homeschooler he doesn't know much about being with people), he apologizes. The bell rings, we go to class. After class him and his buddy come up to me, punch me, and run off. 

This puts me in a bad mood. I storm home. He texts "What's wrong?" I tell him "You, punching me." He then, goes on about how I'm over reacting, because I'm upset, he punched me, and I tell him to go away, not wanting to talk, and he just refuses to believe he did anything wrong.  He then argues, that "I should just suck it up, it's your fault you're in pain, if you weren't so weak, it wouldn't have hurt!"

I then at that very moment, lose it, sh*t hits the fan. I tell him "Screw off. We're not friends. I don't wanna be associated with a person who believe they're not ever at fault." I haven't talk to him since. This was a few hours ago. So I'm just lost. He's one of the few people I had left. 

I'd just like a Pizza to cheer me up.
