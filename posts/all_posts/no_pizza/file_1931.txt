I'm recently graduated college with a BS in mathematics and there is nothing I can find with it. I have no money and my Link card has been shut down so I can't buy food. I have no money because I put everything I had into paying rent for october. At the end of October if I don't figure something out I'm toast. All I'm asking is for some pizza. I haven't eaten today and the last of my oatmeal ran out two days ago. 

If it matters I'm active in r/learnmath where I try to answer math questions related to combinatorics, probability, analysis, and Calculus. 

If anybody decides to respond I have a verification code I can e-mail and I feel I would owe you eternally.
