I don't normally do this but my husband and I are in a bit of a financial pickle. I currently do not have a job, but I am looking. We're struggling 
quite a bit, at the moment we genuinely only have $19.00 in our checking and $0.75 in our savings. We have to make that last for the next week until he gets paid. I haven't told him that I made this request, I think that it would really cheer him up if a kind person randomly pizzaed us.
