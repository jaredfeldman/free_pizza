Hi, to whomever kind soul might be reading this, I am pleading for someone to help/bring a smile to my family. Yesterday, my mother went to the doctor, and her doctor said she has a possible chance of having ovarian tumor. She does not want us to worry but we all know how scared she is. She is the caretaker of the family, and with money being short right now, I know she is stress about having surgery if she does have the ovarian tumor. I do not have any money since I am going to surprise my mother with the money for her to use whatever little money I have given her for the surgery. I am begging a kind soul to possibly donate an ecard for my family so we can have a family meal as well as to let her know that there are people out there who are supporting her. I know there is alot of fraud on this page, but my story is true. Please help my family thank you.
