My grandmother passed away 2 years ago. I grew up a block away so I played at her house often growing up. When the opportunity came to buy her 96 olds, it was like a little piece of her was back with me. That was until today. I was at work during a blizzard, and was relieved when the store closed early. Driving home on a main highway, a truck backed out while he was plowing a parking lot. I couldn't stop. I wasn't injured except from a cut from the airbag and a bump on the knee. Here's my proof. http://i.imgur.com/0LbolU1.jpg. I hate asking, but could some one help me out? I could care less about the car, accidents happen. But the fact that it was my grandmas...that crushed me.
