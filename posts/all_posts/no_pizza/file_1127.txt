I just moved into a new apartment, and I'm really strapped for cash until the end of this week, when my new job starts up. Not only that, but school will be starting in 2 weeks, and I'm sure once that happens I won't get the chance to relax a whole lot either. I'll be sure to pay if forward once I get some money, as well, so I'm not being a total bum. Thanks!
