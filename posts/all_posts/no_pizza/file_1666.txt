I haven't drawn anything lately and we're broke until Friday. [Here's my deviantART gallery](http://androidar.deviantart.com/gallery/) so you can see my skill and what I usually draw. All characters and species of my own creation (minus the Ponies of course). I can do sketches and I'm pretty fantastic with MS Paint, if I do say so myself.

I will draw something for someone in exchange for a yummy warm pizza for the 3 of us (Fiancee, son and myself).

If someone is feeling more than generous in their pizza giving (more than one pizza, extra tasties), I will have my talented fiancee bring life and colour to the sketch. She's awesome.

Thank you.
