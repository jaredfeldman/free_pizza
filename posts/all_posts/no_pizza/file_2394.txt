Basically, my pregnant girlfriend and I have been getting screwed over by a friend that owes us money. He was supposed to pay us the day after last pay day, but didn't.
    

For the last week we've been stuck splitting a 6" Subway sub every day (She gets a free 6" for working there).
A pizza would be very much so appreciated, by me, and I'm sure it'd make a craving packed soon to be mommy very happy as well.

    
Regardless of if anyone helps us out or not, I'll be sending a pizza someone's way when I get paid. 


Thanks for reading guys.  -Shane
