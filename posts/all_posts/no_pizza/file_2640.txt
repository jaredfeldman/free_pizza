My sister, an amazing person, is in a bit of a financial pinch. I really want to try to do something nice for her, but I'm in a bad patch myself. If anyone would be willing to help me send her and her family (husband, presschool son) a pizza to start off a nice weekend, I would appreciate it greatly. Thanks so much in advance for the consideration.
