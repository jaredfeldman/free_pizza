Hi guys, I am a broke college student who has been living off of ramen and eggs for the better part of 2 weeks now. 

I have a gig tomorrow that is paying well, but I had my last bag of ramen today and wont have any more food until tomorrow. I tried to make it last, but I'm at the point where I have finally swallowed my pride.

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.

Thank you - duitse
