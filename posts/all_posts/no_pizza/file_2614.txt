Well, I do tech support here in Fayetteville, NC. I got sick a couple of weeks ago and had to go to the doc. I don't have insurance yet, so that tapped out my savings, to start. It also got slow at work, which meant I had to leave early several days in a row.

I just barely made rent. I had 5 bucks left to go grocery shopping on. I bought a 10lb bag of rice and some flavorings (pizza sauce, soy sauce, salsa that was on sale) and have been eating that for the last week. At this point, I just want something with some flavor. I get paid on the 20th, and would love to buy a pizza or two then for someone.

Just figured I would ask. It may work, it may not. Never know.
