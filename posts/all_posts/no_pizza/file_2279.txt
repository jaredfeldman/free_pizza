This is obviously a throwaway. I've attempted to make a request before, but no one fulfilled it. I decided it would be wise to disclose a bit more about my situation, but I'm super embarrassed, hence the throwaway. If anyone offers, I'd be more than happy to message you via my regular reddit account. I've given and received before. 

Things are looking pretty bleak for us, food-wise (thankfully, we're okay in other areas of our lives). It is literally just food. I'm embarrassed to say this, but we're at a point where we had to apply for food stamps. (I don't think there is anything wrong with food stamps or people who need them, I just never thought we'd be in this dire state of need.) I got all my verification turned in, but it is taking them so long to process it. I am hoping we get it before Thanksgiving, since their office will be closed from Thursday-Monday. I don't know what I'll do if they fail to complete processing my application before their Thanksgiving break. From the way things are going, it seems unlikely.

If anyone could send me a gift card for a pizza, I'd be so grateful. I'd pay it forward in anyway I can. 

We couldn't pay our internet/phone bill. Thankfully, free wi-fi is only a short walk away. If you respond to this, please understand that I probably won't be able to respond to you until tomorrow morning.
