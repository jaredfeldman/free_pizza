just looking to get some good eats. i'm broke until pay day tomorrow, and all my co-workers decided to order elaborate carry out food. now my job smells like a cafeteria and all i have to eat is the inside of my cheek. a random act of pizza would be amazing, and would gladly return the favor post-pay day to you (pizza buyee) or anyone else in need of pizza. ;\ thanks!
