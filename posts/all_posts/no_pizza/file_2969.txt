Hi! I just found this amazing place, and thought I'd give a nice funny title to my post (Although I am an ethnic minority). 

Anyways.. I've been sitting at my computer for the past 18 hours studying Calculus and Physics, both are tomorrow and I have a 1 hour drive to school to :( If someone can help a student who has nothing now but will have something later, it'd mean the world!
