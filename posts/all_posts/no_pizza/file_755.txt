Throwaway bc this is embarrassing. Ben off work for a few weeks (injury, still have a job just can't work until i'm better), no money until end of jan (screw u ei) and bank account pretty empty. My roommate has been awesome about groceries but he had to leave town a couple days ago bc of a funeral. Fridge &amp; cupboards basically empty.

So anyone feel like sending me some pizza?
