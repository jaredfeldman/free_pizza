I run a business doing smartphone unlocking. I will unlock your phone for pizza. I'm not necessarily broke, I'm just feeling lazy today. I can't do every model, and it's pretty much limited to either AT&amp;T or T-Mobile phones. I can't do every kind of phone, but here is a suggestion of ones I am willing to do with processing time involved:
AT&amp;T iPhone (1-24 Hour) AT&amp;T Non-iPhone (1-24 Hour) T-Mobile HTC (Instant [1-60Min]) AT&amp;T HTC (Instant [1-60Min]) Blackberry (Instant [1-60Min])
iPhones are unlocked through iTunes, all others are unlocked with a code. You are required to have a SIM Card from another carrier to complete the unlock. I am just going to give you the unlock code.
Also I have to mention, I cannot unlock your phone if it was put into contract on or after January 26, 2013...so please only older phones.
