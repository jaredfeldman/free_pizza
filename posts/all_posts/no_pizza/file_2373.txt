The title pretty much says it all.  I'm dirt poor at this point, trying to find any sort of job, be it part time or just a day laborer, I'll do anything just to have a couple bucks to rub together.

I'm starving, depressed, and love the Reddit community, so if anyone has it in their heart today to help out a beaten down man, I'd be ever grateful.

Thanks
