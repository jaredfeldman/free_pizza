It's the last day of the holidays and I head back to Uni, UoB, this Monday. Will be travelling all day tomorrow to get back up North so this will be my last meal before heading up.
Any kind souls who feel up for helping me have a hot meal before driving all day would be loved eternally till the resurrection of FSM.

Thanks &lt;3
