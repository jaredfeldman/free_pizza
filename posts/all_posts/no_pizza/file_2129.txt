I'm sitting at home contemplating eating a tunafish and ketchup sandwich because that's all I have left in my pantry.  I work at a restaurant where I make 9.75 an hour but I'm currently barely paying for my rent (which includes my gas and water bills). I just paid rent on the 7th after having scrapped together the tips I make off the grill I work to pay for rent.  I've got a total of 2.71 in my bank account and I don't get paid until next Tuesday.  I've got the next 2 days off and while I will be able to buy some food Saturday with my grill tips I only usually make about $15 bucks after a 6 hour shift.  

If anyone would be kind of enough to fulfill my offer I will be back next Tuesday to return the favor to some lucky human or humans. If I don't return the favor by Tuesday.  I will post a picture of my shame to /r/pics explaining my unconscionable behavior.
