We all know that period between student loans when you're stretching every penny you have. Unfortunately for me my housemates decided to shaft me by all buying stuff just before bills, meaning i was the only one with the money to pay them this month. This has left me with just enough to cover rent until the loan comes in later this month, but until then, and until I can get the money back from housemates, I'm a little on the food-light side of life.

Any pizza would be much appreciated &lt;3
