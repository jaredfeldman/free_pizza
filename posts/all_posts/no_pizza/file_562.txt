I wanted to lean on the community really quick for some pizza tonight.   Lost my bank card on Saturday afternoon and I am really sick of oatmeal and frozen veggies, since that  is the only thing left in the fridge.  

I give my word I will pay it forward by the end of this week if not sooner and get some else pizza.

Thanks for reading
