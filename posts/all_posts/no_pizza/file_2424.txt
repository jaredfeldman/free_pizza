I moved to Canada from the states to be with her and can't work until I get my residency approved.  She's working two jobs just so she can go back to school because she **hates** what she's doing right now.  

Tomorrow is our two year anniversary and I'd love to surprise her with some good pizza(and lava cakes!)
