I recently turned 18 and graduated from high school and I'm a YouTuber.  Currently, being apart of the partner program does not bring in that much (a few cents a day) and I'm having my first scripting meeting with some other content creators.  Money is tight and it would be much appreciated if someone could help feed the brains of a couple of teens working on their passion.

P.S.  I'll list you in credits for "Executive Producer".  It's Star Wars related.  In fact, I just finished learning lightsaber FX (finally), I'll link the video testing.  [VIDEO](http://youtu.be/TD6JiAJzXRM)
