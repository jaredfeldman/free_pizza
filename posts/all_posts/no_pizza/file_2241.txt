~~I lost my job today after being really sick for a couple of days. I tried to make bean burritos tonight, but after hours of cooking, the beans are still hard! I'm very hungry but very broke. Any kindness would be greatly appreciated.~~

Upon researching our scenario, I remembered a recent credit card bill I paid a bit of. Thankfully, we'll be able to afford our food for the night. We (Necrizzo and his g/f) can thankfully splurge on some 'za for ourselves tonight.
