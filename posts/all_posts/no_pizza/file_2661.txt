Today is my Twins 5th birthday today, I couldn't afford to get them any presents with my situation right now. A friend suggested I check out this site. My Kidslove pizza, we are at the library right now hoping that someone can help get us some pizza. Mama bear will repay back any help that we get, as soon as I can. We are new to Reddit and Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, but have a feeling that we will be giving a lot once mama bear gets backs on her feet. We will offer drawings of pizza, or anything that you like in return for this awesome bday gift.
