Im sorry for having to ask. I know thats the whole point but I always feel bad for asking for help. I am a 22yo veteran of the Army Reserve who is currently being medically discharged for Bipolar Affective Disorder type 2(severe depression, dysphoric hypomania). I have tried to work but I have chest pains and anxiety attacks from ptsd. I try my hardest to hold out but i cant work if Im curled up in the bathroom praying for death. Im just trying to explain why Im so broke. I cant get any VA benefits until my claim is processed(months from now) so I have to pay for my meds out of pocket. I make 20$ a week taking an experimental sleep medication in a clinical trial but most of that goes to bus fare, meds(Ive got a few rx's), and stretching out food. I applied for food stamps but my card was delayed(stolen out of mailbox) and now I wont see it until a couple weeks. Im living with my roommate who has been kind enough to only ask me for 50 a month in rent, but that leaves little room for pizza! I honestly havent had a pizza this year. Its one of the few things that makes me feel better, like theres something to live for and look forward to again. maybe Im not the most deserving, but it would really help me out. Thanks for reading this.
