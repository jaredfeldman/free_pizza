Dear /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza

I come before you now as a humble man. I would like to think I am an honest man so I shall tell you an honest tale. 

My name is Dave and I currently am working at a Homeless shelter for homeless youth in Seattle called ROOTS. I love working at ROOTS, I can sleep easily in the mornings (since I work throughout the nights) knowing that I am helping keeping 30 homeless youth off the streets and away from SNOWzilla's wrath as he stomps through Seattle. 

SNOWzilla has ruined things here in Seattle. Because of the nature of the place I work at, someone MUST be on staff every night, and I have to work throughout the weekend and since the buses are closed? I must walk 5 miles in ice and snow to get to work. 

Sadly though, I don't get paid very much. [(Bank Statement)](http://imgur.com/DvEeh) But that is the way of the world working for a homeless shelter. I haven't eaten in the last day and a half because of there being nothing in my kitchen [My fridge](http://imgur.com/05ffR) and stores being closed.

So I am asking you all, if you are willing, would be able to show a snowed-in man with no money some kindness? Even under these difficult times, and even if whether or not my ask for some kindness has no results, know that I have fun even when times are grim [I did it all for you, Reddit!](http://imgur.com/bhnxu)

I hope you can all find it in your hearts to give some kindness my way. I hope you all have a SAFE time as snowzilla causes havoc in everyone's regions and I live you with one last picture.
