I have been unemployed since March of 2011 through no fault of my own. I have taken odd jobs and sold everything of value. I'm not looking for sympathy, but perhaps some understanding if you've been in this situation before. Things have been bumpy for me, but I have kept faith that things will look up. I spend my days looking for work, following up on applications that I've submitted, and just trying to figure out how I'll get my bills paid. It has been mentally and physically exhausting.

My bills are paid but I am down to a few cans of peas and ramen. I won't be able to buy any food until next month. I would love a pizza and savor every single bite. You have no idea! Simple things like going to Mc Donalds or even just going out to eat at any restaurant..I haven't been able to afford to do this. 

Because I'm a man with pride and work ethic, I would like to do some work for you. If you're near or in Reading, I am offering to clean your attic or do some yard work. If you're not near Reading, I will offer my computer skills to you. I can help you with anything Microsoft office related. 

I am not new to Reddit, despite what the bot may say. This is my first and only request. I am seeking to work for a pizza and I hope that this is allowed. I know this is random but please consider me. Thank you for reading my post.
