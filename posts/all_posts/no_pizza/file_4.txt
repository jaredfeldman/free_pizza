hey guys:
 I love this sub. I think it's great. (Except the sob stories. I miss when this place was fun!) Anywho, I've given a pizza out before so thought I would try my luck at getting one. My friend, who lives an hour away and our schedules do not let us see each other too much, decided to come down and visit me for the night! I would love to be able to be a good host and order her a pizza to go with some beer!

Again, no sob story. Just looking to share a pizza with an old friend :)
