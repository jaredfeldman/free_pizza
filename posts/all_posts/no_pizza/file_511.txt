I'm unemployed and have been chasing after job opportunities... Last night I got an IM from the president of a company with a promising job opportunity, only he told me that everything would be delayed because of issues with FCC regulations and I wouldn't start until February at the earliest. Yesterday my laptop broke and I had to send it in to Apple for repairs. This afternoon I broke the mirror on the closet door while putting a box back in the closet. I called around for quotes on a new mirror. It's going to cost me $100 to replace the mirror. I have to do it, as it's my landlady's property. Kinda bums me out, but it has to be done.

While it's not necessary, some delicious pizza would cheer me up quite a bit. I'll be able to pay it forward this weekend when I get some money. Thank you! :)
