I am stuck staying with my parents for a couple weeks in one of the most backwoods, behind the times, boring places ever.  There is nothing for a girl like me to do around here, and [this](http://untitled38057.tumblr.com/post/27547768540/ladelthia) is me. I don't quite fit in down here. It is very .... country here. The one redeeming factor is that they do have a few pizza places here. We have Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Papa Johns! I have literally been eating the same three meals every day for the last two weeks. I eat cereal for breakfast, a bologna sandwich for lunch and ramen for dinner. I could REALLY go for a nice pizza to wake my taste buds up from this coma. If you guys could help me out with this, I would greatly appreciate it! I will even take pictures of me eating that delicious pizza and post them for you guys to see! Please and thank you?
