Hello everyone, my buddy wanted to help me out so he told me about this fantastic place (hence this account being made today). I am a single soldier stationed at fort campbell. Today I've noticed instead of withdrawing the normal $150 for my car payment my bank has taken out $600 dollars leaving me -$527 in my bank account. They said they'll fix it but not till they open again on Monday. Normally this would be alright because I have a meal card except this weekend my on post dining facilities have closed for the Easter weekend. I haven't eaten since breakfast on Friday and could really use some food. Anything would do. I don't have a car or I'd try and forage around. This is literally my last option at this point.  If you want proof of the bank account I can send you a picture, if you can tell me how to take a screen cap of my phone (my only internet access).

Again thank you, and if you don't trust a new account I fully understand I'm just desperate.
