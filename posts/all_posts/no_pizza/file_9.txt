I am a stay at home mom of two kids i live with my husband his parents and my kids! The only reason that I am unemployed is because my husband was hit by a drunk driver a little over a year ago and was seriously injured and was almost killed! so i quit work to help him through recovery and take care of the kids while living with my in-laws off of their ssi checks (which are tiny)! Its the end of the month and we're broke! We are not starving but we aren't eating all that well either! Please be my pizza hero!
