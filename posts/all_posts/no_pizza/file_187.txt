I have no where else to turn. My husband lost his job and I work part-time at the local Walmart stocking shelves. My check doesn't even cover our rent, I have our utilities paid and have spoken to the landlord. I am eligible to go back to the food pantry on Friday. (You can only go once a month) so I just need something to hold us(my two children, my husband, and myself) until Friday, and the kids get free breakfast and lunch at school. So I really just need enough for two dinners. I can repay when money comes in or whatever you like. Thank you for taking time to read my plea.
