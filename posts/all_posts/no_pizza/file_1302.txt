So I've never posted in RAOP before but a friend suggested I come here. Yesterday a pair of pits attacked me and my dog while walking around my neighborhood and I just paid off the vet and hospital bills this morning. It really has left me with $6.88 and means I have no money to eat for a week. I'm going to try and find a way to get food for the meantime (food pantry perhaps?) but after the stress a pizza would be amazing.

If you are willing to help me make it through this week with offers of pizza until I get paid, every single pizza will be paid forward after pay day.

This is Indiana:

Photos of bill available if that kind of thing is needed. I have a verification code to give as well. This is my first time ever here so, apologizes if I've broken a rule I didn't see.

***P.S. To any one out there considering getting an pitbull terrier THIS SHOULD IN NO WAY AFFECT YOUR DECISION.*** Indiana is part pit and pits are absolutely lovely creatures. The owner trained them for defense and fighting then let them get loose. I am already broken up about them getting destroyed. Responsible and loving dog owners know that pits are wonderful.
