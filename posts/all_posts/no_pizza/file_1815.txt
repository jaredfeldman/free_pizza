Not exactly urgent, but my oven is currently broken and I don't have anything to eat that I do not have to cook somehow. Pizza sounds great tonight, but my bank account is drained (damn cell phone bills!). I will pay it forward at some point if someone buys. There are others more needy than I am though so if you feel someone else needs it more (i.e. families), please do it for them instead. Just thought I'd post this on here in case anyone was feeling generous.
