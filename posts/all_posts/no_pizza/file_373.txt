Just as the title says. I miss calculated my living expensive and ran out by May. Ive been living off student loan money since I've been having trouble with finding work. I had to sell just about everything of value except my phone and damaged tablet just to pay rent for the last few months. I just topped off my bag of rice and down to Oatmeal and a bag of Beans. I get this semester of loans in 2 weeks, but a Dominos pizza would make this US student very happy. Even just breadsticks would do. 


Sorry for my long sob story.
