My wallet got stolen two weeks ago and due to complications with my address can't get my new card until friday. Bank was closed all weekend and burned through all my reserve 20p noodles.

Haven't had anything today and need to walk over 4km tomorrow (edit: to the bank in town) because cant afford the bus, would appreciate the energy boost
