Firstly, this is a throwaway account because I really don't want my mother to know I'm struggling, and she stalks my main account. If you want to see my main account (its over 2 years old) I'll send it to you in a pm and prove its mine. :/

I got back into town today and all my roommates stuff has been moved out, along with every piece of food in the house. That means I have to pick up his half of the rent which means i'm really broke. :( A pizza would really help if anybody is feeling generous tonight. Thanks!
