My boyfriend and I live in Saint Augustine, Florida and have been having a rough time financially the past few months.  In and out of various jobs, we've had to survive off of coscto sized ramen packs, and pasta and olive oil.  I applied for food stamps a couple days ago, and am waiting to hear back from them.  It's getting a little trite, and we're quite hungry tonight, a hot pizza would be a delight.  We'll happily pay it forward in the future.  Much love.
