I graduated last fall with a major in communications. I definitely regret not choosing a major that was more profitable, as I am still working the same retail job that I've had for a few years. I don't mind my job but I'm ready to branch out and find something better. As I got closer and closer to my graduation date I kept telling myself that 2012 is my year. I am not new to Reddit or living check to check, so I'm here looking for a mutual exchange. I'm proficient with Microsoft Office, Photoshop, Quickbooks, and researching just about any topic for you. It has been so long since I've had a meal that wasn't rice, beans or noodles. I'm very grateful for what I have, but a pizza would just rock my world! Please let me know what kind of work you would like to have done and any deadlines if possible. Thank you for considering me.
