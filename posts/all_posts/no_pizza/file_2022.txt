Hello reddit,

Here's our story.

We're at a friend's house in (essentially) the middle of nowhere. We've come down to stay for a few days, and none of us have cars, so we're essentially stuck food free.

Now, here's the tricky part. The two people we are staying with are currently having 'a relationship tiff'. Essentially they've left us downstairs, post several joints, and we have absolutely no food, and a tremendous, burning desire for it.

We're sat desperately hoping they aren't breaking up, as this would be seriously uncool whilst high, and it would firmly delay our chance to eat pizza.

Thank you.
