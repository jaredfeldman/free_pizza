Hey guys, I'm feeling a bit lonely at the moment - a lot of problems came crashing down and I just need a little pick me up. Financials have been bad, my relationship with my parents is going downhill and I'm tired of eating pasta with butter for dinner.

I can't offer much in return, but I have quite a few books I wouldn't mind sending you, mostly classics but a few contemporary works. I also do web design and could set up a little personalized page for you (or anyone of your choice) on my domain.

Thanks guys, and I hope to be able to offer a pizza soon... This sub makes me smile =)
