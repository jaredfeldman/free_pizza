I've recently graduated university. I think I have a pretty decent resume (working on a successful political campaign, interning at a Congressional office, etc) but I cannot for the life of me find a job. Not having a car in a very difficult city to commute in is definitely a problem, but it doesn't stop me from taking the bus. But I can only go so far. A two hour bus ride makes an 8 hour day become a 12 hour day. And scheduling multiple interviews is difficult when I'm relying on the bus to take me. Nevertheless, I'm still pushing through and hoping that if nothing, Walmart will come through.

So yeah, I have to move out by August 1st. My roommates want me to sign a new lease at a different apartment complex to move in by July 22nd, but I don't know that I can do it. I'm almost absolutely broke and it really sucks. It's a mixture of embarrassing, frustrating, and sad. I don't want to move back home but I don't know what to do. I feel like I graduated and I did a lot right to secure a decent job or prospects, but I guess I didn't. I'm studying for the LSAT and I'll take it in October. I plan on scoring well enough to go to a good law school, but that's so far away.

I dunno, I'm rambling. What's up RAOP?
