My life isn't particularly terrible or anything, but I'm spending from now until tuesday buried in books and essays preparing for next weeks finals, and that's just no fun. I have $5 left for the semester, but it's gonna need to be spent on 7/11 coffee to get me through. I'd love a pizza for morale and just to be done with my stockpile of microwave bagel bites (even though they were amazing about 15 boxes ago.)

I'm a big fan of Dominos, but obviously, anything would be more than appreciated.

Also, when school's out and I'm back home, it will be easier to come by money and I would love to return the favor. 
Thanks in advance, and hell thanks for anyone who has given on this subreddit, just for being a kickass person.
