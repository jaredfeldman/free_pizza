I found an article in CNN about raop while stumbling and it was like a sign. I've seen reddit before but never made an account so this is a good a time as any. Me and my daughter are going through some rough times. I'm single and work my ass off in a school cafeteria for minimum wage to try and make ends meet. I'm pretty broke right now and I really don't know if I can do rent even. I hate not being able to provide everything to my kid because of circumstance. Our food stamps haven't come in yet so we're pretty much out of food. I really don't know what I'm going to feed Lexie for lunch. If some kind stranger could help us out with a pizza it would be very appreciated.
