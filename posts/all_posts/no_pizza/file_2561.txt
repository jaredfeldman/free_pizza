Holidays are rough for our family this year, and aren't going to be that good. Kind of has us depressed. Regardless we managed to pick up a couple things for each other and our boys and would love to end our bargain hunting night with a pizza. A little holiday cheer if you will for us and the kids. 

This is simply a want, not a need. We have other things to make up in the house for dinner, just would be nice to have a pizza for a treat.. Been lurking here and other reddits once in awhile and enjoy seeing each one of you giving :)
