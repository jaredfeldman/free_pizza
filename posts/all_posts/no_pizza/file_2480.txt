Hey guys, im very hungry. i havent eaten all day, and have been hungry the psat few weeks since i lost my job. Im 18 and my parents live four states away. I live in a townhouse with 5 other guys and seeing them all bring their thanksgiving leftovers home really sucked, as i spent it by myself eating what was left of my canned soup. Today has been the breaking point where i have to ask, im starving:(
