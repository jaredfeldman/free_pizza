I have a CSGO match and will be practicing until our the match at 9:00.  BUT...today is my GF day to work late and when she gets home I already know she isn't going to be in the mood to cook. Our money is tied up with xmas gifts until next pay day, so just wondering if anybody can help us out so we can get our munch on?!
