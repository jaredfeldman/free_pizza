Title pretty much explains it all, I am in fact dirt broke, I've even started putting up anything valuable on ebay. I probably won't have a dime for another week or two, my mom also just told me she has a pancreatic tumor that has spread to her liver, I'm just down in general right now. I would love the comfort food of pizza, especially now that I can't even afford to stick to my paleo diet.
