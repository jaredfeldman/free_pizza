Okay I'm not going to lie- I'm addicted to cheese and I've been struggling hard this week. I received a hefty bill and so needs must. But now I'm getting the withdrawals...im bleary eyed and craving hard. Is anyone able to help me!?! Would be greatly appreciated :D
I get paid on the 28th of the month but would gladly return the favour!
EDIT #1: I should mention I'm in the UK.
EDIT #2: I should also mention its been almost a week since I've had any kind of 'tasty' food....please!!!
