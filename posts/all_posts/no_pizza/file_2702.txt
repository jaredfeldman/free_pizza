I am embarrassed to ask...but I started a new job a week ago (no paycheck for two weeks) and my kids have been eating rice for three days.  They have been far more understanding than they had to be.  I would really love to give them something special tonight (but I cannot).  If any one could help save them from yet another night of white rice, I would be most grateful.   And would love to pay it forward when I get paid next week!
