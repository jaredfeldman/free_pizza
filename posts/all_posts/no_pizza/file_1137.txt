I've just gotten back from holiday today (Greece) which was a clusterfuck of disasters - I was robbed, my iPhone stolen and my money, and have several stitches above my eye to boot. While I was away my girlfriend had her apartment broken into by a lone male and she woke up with him assaulting her luckily she screamed and he was frightened away by her housemate running in, but it could have been a LOT worse. 

she has some facial bruising and bruises to her hands, and from talking to her on the phone tonight she is pretty terrified. As a backstory, my girlfriend is from my town but is working 3500 miles away in columbus, ohio, until the end of next year, meaning I cant be there to make her feel better  &amp; thanks to my mishaps while abroad, I have no money to do anything about it and no way to talk to her other than landline calling (we've tried skype but it drops constantly - facetime is a dream come true for us but it will be around 20 days til my insurance coughs up for a replacement phone, so its going to be a nightmare until then!)

so basically I'd like some help in cheering up the poor girl. for obvious reasons giving her address out on the internet right now would be a big no-no, but i'm not sure if there is any other way to do it? if there isnt, then can someone from there give me some pointers on an online site i can order for her? i don't mind racking up some over limit fees if it comes to it &amp; last thing I want to do is come across as a scammer. (you can see I did post an askreddit about the incident yesterday, alas it didn't get a single reply! img-foreveralone).

if anyone can help, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks
