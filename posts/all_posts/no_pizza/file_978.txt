I work in a restaurant and my manager is firing people and cutting hours. I am now only going to be working steadily 2 days a week, and next week I go back to school, so finding a second job right away with any flexibility is gonna be difficult. The bf and I have irons in the fire, but we're stressing out and worried about how we're going to get by. A hot pizza and a reminder that acts of kindness are still occasionally possible in this world would go a long way toward cheering up our little family.  I'm in the Louisville KY area. Thanks reddit!
