My good friend lives in Norcal and she and her husband have been out of work for a long time. They have a little girl, and won't take any more help from me because they feel indebted and quite frankly I'm not in a financial position to be able to at the moment. I think if a magical pizza appeared at their door, it would make their night/week!
