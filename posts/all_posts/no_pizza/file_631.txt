I've been job hunting for three months now, this was meant to be my first summer living away from home but it's all gone wrong, I'm exhausted and a bit scared of what's going to happen. I'm blessed to be able to do enough cash in hand jobs to keep the rent people happy but right now I'm wishing for nothing more than a disk of dough with some cheese ontop. 
Much love, good luck to any of you who might be trying to find a job in this crazy market atm. 

EDIT: No word from Gaga :( any still looking gentle anons. 

EDIT EDIT: I have no idea what "any still looking" means. 

EDIT EDIT EDIT: I lovely young gentleman has brought up the subject of my account only being two months old, this would be a good point if it weren't for the fact that more than two seconds on my account shows I have been using my account for a lot of posts etc and this is actually my first time posting on this sub.
