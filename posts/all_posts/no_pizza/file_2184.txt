I'm completely in love with this subreddit, I think it is absolutely amazing that people are this nice to strangers! Had no idea reddit had such amazing people here! Any who, I'm a new mom, daddy works an hour away and long shifts. There is food in my house, I just can't find the time to make myself a decent meal while taking care of the baby. I do eat a ton of cereal lately haha, it's the easiest thing here.  Would love a pizza but I know there are a lot more people here that need it more than me. Regardless I still think what you guys do is great and would love to participate in the giving soon!
