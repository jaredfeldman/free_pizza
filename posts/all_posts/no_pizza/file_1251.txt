currently living in my car with my 55 year old mother and 2 dogs. We both lost our jobs in 08 and we moved from Toronto to Vancouver after trying to survive out east for work it was hit and miss, so we sold what we had and drove across canada. I just recently got a good job out here in Vancouver and hoping to get a place for Nov 1st. But we are out of food and gas as I'm waiting for my check on the 15th but we are all starving a random act of pizza would greatly lift our spirits. 

**UPDATE** 
Thanks for those that reached out to us the community centre closed at 9 near us which had the internet, but some guy outside noticed us shuffling things around in the car getting ready for bed and came over to us to talk, at first we were a bit freaked out but the guy was nice and gave us 40 bucks to get some grub and gas, I still didn't get that pizza cause the safeway was the closest place but hey maybe on my pay day on the 15th!! thanks again for all that responded and offered help
