I got fired over a stupid coworker messing up. He stole my swipe card, signed into the cash till and $300 went missing. Because my name was on the register, i got canned. It's been a really bad day and I just need a pick me up in the form of pizza.
    
I live in Canada if that helps. I fully plan to pay it forward when I can, I just can't spend anything right now.
