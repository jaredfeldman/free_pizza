We have three kids, two with autism, and one of them has been throwing a violent tantrum since about 8pm. Our townhouse is very small, and the other two kids can't be in their beds right now for safety reasons, so they're "going to sleep" in the rec room. Obviously they're still awake. I don't get paid until Thursday, and we could really use a pizza to make this less awful on the family.
