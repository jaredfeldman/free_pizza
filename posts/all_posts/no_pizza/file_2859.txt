The title pretty much says it, if you need verification, or more info or anything else please PM me. I messed up once and I'm hoping on going on a 'Highventure' to make things better than they were before I lost her.  Oh and BTW, she's leaving to college real soon so I'm a little worried having all this pressure and whatnot. If you have any ideas on having a memorable Entventure please do tell. Thank you.
