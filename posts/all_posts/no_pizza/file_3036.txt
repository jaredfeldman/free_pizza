I'm home from college for the summer and my parents are gone for the weekend. Unfortunately, my LCD screen failed on my toshiba laptop and after shipping it to them, they've told me that I owe them $200 for fixing the POWER JACK before they'll fix my screen despite the fact that it's under warranty and that I didn't send it in for them to fix anything but the screen. After arguing with them over a span of two days and looking at other options, I gave in and am now broke. I've eaten ramen for virtually every meal for the past 2 and a half days and I can't do it anymore. It would be sweet if a fellow redditor could help a guy out.
