My husband &amp; I have been living with family until our new place was ready for us to move in. After NIPSCO, water, moving trucks, storage bill, we are completely tapped out. We sent our two year old to my dad's since we didn't have much in the way of food. I don't get know when the food pantry is open around here, or else I would be there! Not too proud for that. We were just laying around, listing what food would hit the spot!
