-A weird power struggle at my fathers work ousted him of his position and severance pay.

-We both spent most of our remaining funds on a car we can share because he will no longer have a company car to drive.

-Pizza sounds great right now but we're both too broke for one. 

-Any words/thoughts/pizzas greatly appreciated
