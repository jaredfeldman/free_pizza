Today is my birthday! sadly there's nothing to do here at all. i have no money. neither does my family, who isn't here, so i'm alone on my birthday with no food really. i mean we have some bread and some milk and some rice i think in the fridge but i've been eating that for weeks. My girlfriend just broke up with me on friday too.. so i can't really do anything today.. also i'm being picked up at 6 for work so ya.. i could really use some pizza today for my birthday. there's a pizza place near me called new york pizza girl the number is (610) 681-4900, PM me for my information, if you'd like to give me a birthday present that is
