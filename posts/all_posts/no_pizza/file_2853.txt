Well like the title says, just basically looking for an angel, somebody to guide me, a big brother or just simply a break. I'm 18 going into my 2nd year of college and on the top ramen diet. I am broke, I got less a dollar in my bank account. Books have taken the most of $ and I have been applying for jobs but it has not been easy. If you can find it in your heart to simply give someone a break. Please it would be great. I promise to pass it on when I get my loans in.
