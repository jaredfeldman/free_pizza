I am the mom of 4 children and the wife of a wonderful husband.  Some background info: my husband was in an auto accident on 8/14 and when he was finally able to return to work 9/7, he was told there is not enough work for him and that he should look for a new job.  THIS after he was working 55-60 hours a week before the accident (he was a passenger).  We went through our savings during his time out and have overdrawn our Netspend account over $90.  Our family has been living off of boxed mashed potatoes and the cheap boxed mac and cheese.  I have used the food bank already this month and I am waiting on DSS to approve my food stamp app.  I am trying to do everything right.
It is 4:55 and every kid (ages 15, 13, 13 and 7) has all been asking about dinner.  They know their dad lost his job but they don't know about our financial situation of not only being broke but being negative in the bank.  
I am not worried about myself or my husband eating.  I would just really like for my children to have a filling dinner.  We have no bread, no milk, no meat.  Just one cheese and one pepperoni pizza would mean more to my family than I can express.  I know we will be back on our feet within a month.  I have faith in that.  I am a strong believer in paying it forward.  Any info or verification you need, please don't hesitate to ask.  I do have a verification code if someone is willing to help.
Thank you for taking the time to read and consider my request.  This is very humbling but I want to put my pride away in hopes of my family having a filling meal tonight.
