Don't mean to beg, but I had been left to care for my parents' dogs for the week. However, they didn't leave me much money for the week to buy groceries (they left last Saturday) and I haven't really had much to eat. I'd grab groceries but I just made a huge school payment and am doing pretty lousy. 

If you're a producer or musician, I'd love to discuss works with you, or check out your tracks. I'll try and advertise some of your work in gratitude :)
