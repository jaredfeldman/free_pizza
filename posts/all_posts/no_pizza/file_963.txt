I'm in southwestern Michigan, and I've kinda lost all hope in this situation. My buddy and I haven't had anything to eat for a while now and I don't think we can afford to. If anyone could help I would really appreciate it, we ran out of Raman noodles a couple days ago and don't know what to do... Our finances are even screwed for this next month completely, I need some little beacon of light and a pizza would go a long way right now.
