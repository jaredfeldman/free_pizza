FORGOT TO PUT LOCATION - RHODE ISLAND

So there are three of us living here. Two adult males, and an adult female. 
Somehow our finances were completely drained this month. no food, no money, paycheck isn't coming until the second, and we're apparently too rich for food pantries. 
Our resident artist has said she will draw anything you like, and our resident... something has said he will thank you profusely as he has no discernable skills that can be applied to the internet. (he's really good at RPGs. doesnt help here.) 
Now there are a thousand pity stories all over the4 internet, so we decided to add a bit of proof. Pics of bank account, fridge, etc.
