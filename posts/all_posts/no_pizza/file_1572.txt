I have four days left in this god awful Philly house and after the security deposit and first/last month rent, our bank accounts are developing cobwebs. My boyfriend and I could seriously benefit from a random act of pizza! It would probably last us about 2/3  days of dinner if we're good which is more than enough. The only one being spoiled with food in this house for the time being is the cat! Any help is well appreciated! My friend told me about RAOP today when I told him how rough its been lately and that I've been sitting on Reddit with a grumbly tummy. (figured I'd give it a shot) If this works out so much gratitude is given.
