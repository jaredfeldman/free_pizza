I work as a valet and normally get the majority of my money in cash tips.  Just moved to a new state and they don't have my bank and so I haven't been able to deposit my pay checks until tomorrow when I work again and get tip money for food.  If you feed me I will dedicate the rest of my afternoon to something productive, also known as rereading Mario Puzo's classic 1969 American Crime Masterpiece, The Godfather.
