It's been a very tight two weeks, and the wife and I are approaching Friday with a very empty wallet.  We have enough gas in the car to get to and from work, but not enough fuel for our bellies.  We're rocking a solid two chicken breasts in the freezer - adequate for one night's dinner.  We're sitting pretty on a whopping ninety-six cent til Friday morning, and getting desperate as to what we're doing for dinner Wednesday or Thursday.

And then I heard about RAOP.  I promise to whomever helps my wife and I in our time of need that we will pass the good fortune on come Friday.
