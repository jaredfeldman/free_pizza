I am taking the GRE this week, so in the midst of midterms I am also studying for this test that will determine the next several years of my life, and ultimately, my career. I don't really have the time or money to deal with food at the  moment. I'm also a small girl, and a pizza will last me several days. Thanks for reading.

Edit: Forgot location... Idaho!
