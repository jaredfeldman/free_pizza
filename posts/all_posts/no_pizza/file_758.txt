My roommate and I finished our finals today, of course we had one at the last timeslot (U of I has a terrible final schedule this year). We'd like to celebrate but it's starting to storm pretty bad out at the moment. A pizza would be delicious, this semester was a rough one. Pretty please? :) I'll gladly pay it forward to a college kid who asks next time around.
