My gas got shut off, I owe a grand to the electric company, I haven't paid my student loan bill in full in months and I have been out of work too long now, even though I have been applying to dozens of jobs a day and am signed up with temping agencies, have a bachelors... I can only afford to eat about once a day now as it is and I can't stop thinking about pizza, which would be a dream at this point. 

I am doing everything I can to try to make ends meet, I work for family, friends, temp, hang IT technician fliers around town, but since I lost my job every other opportunity has seemed to dry up in Chicago. I have an interview tomorrow for a paying internship and I would love to be able to walk in there on a full stomach.

Being Chicago, there are hundreds of pizza places and I am not a picky guy but if you were going to buy me a pizza please don't pizza troll me with anchovies :P I like meat and veggies and would be so grateful if someone could help me take my mind of all the shit that's going on in my life right now with a hot dinner.
