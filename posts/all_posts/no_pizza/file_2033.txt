I honestly can't remember the last time I had pizza. It's a sad life, but when you're unemployed, luxuries such as pizza go away.
Anyway, I've just been craving pizza like mad for a week or so, and I don't want to eat mac and cheese AGAIN for the third time this week.
I'm going to be up super late studying for these 3 chapters and doing quizzes.
Lurked for a while, but never submitted anything to this sub...hoping a generous soul will help out this hungry soul!
