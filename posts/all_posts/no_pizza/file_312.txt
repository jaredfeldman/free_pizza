Hi my cousin kellie told me about this website cause she had received a pizza for her and her son when they were in need.. well i'm going to be completely honest on how it all happened.. my friend took me to a party i drank a little much for myself and jumped off a hayloft in a barn into some card board boxes and snapped my fibula and tibia in half and had to have surgery with a medal rod and four screws in my leg. it happened on june 30th and i have been out of work ever since i work and at lions choice they are holding my job for me but i still have a good four months before i can return to work. i understand it was my stupidity that put me in this place and i am completely flat broke since ive been out of work if someone could help that would be awesome :)
