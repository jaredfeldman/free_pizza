 I've been unemployed for a year and 2 months. Due to being unemployd, I've been living with my fiance's parents. It's been a long, hard road what with money issues and studying for my degree, but I was finally offered a part time job which is set to start on Feb. 28th.  

I'd love to get a pizza to celebrate the good news and the start of a new chapter with the people who've graciously opened their home to me and helped me out this long.  

As soon as I get my first paycheck, I'm buying a fellow reddior some pizza!  
  
  
I'm located in PR.  
Thanks for existing RAoP, you guys are amazing, I love seeing how generous people can be.
