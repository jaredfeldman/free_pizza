Now I know just straight up asking for a pizza isn't really inventive or innovative, but I'm kinda just without any money at all and could go for one or two, saving the slices for a meal every so often.
I think you can probably buy a pizza online from the Pizza Hut or Dominos NZ branch near me from anywhere in the world, but if you're in NZ that's even cooler.
Anyway, yeah. Thanks in advance. I can give you my Steam name and we can have a few games to celebrate if you want, or I could give a little thanks on my Youtube channel if that's what you'd like. I can't really offer much other than that, but yeah, enough rambling.
I guess PM me if you're willing? :D
