I don't like asking people for things, but we're going through a rough couple of months, since my boyfriend is a software contract worker and had to take some time off before starting work again (tomorrow actually is his first day back at Microsoft! Hooray!) BUT, that means we're completely out of money until I get paid on Tuesday, and we would seriously love some pizza. 


I promise to pay it forward on Tuesday and buy someone else in need a pizza. I feel horrible for asking, but we don't really have any other options. We live in the Seattle area, if that helps. Thank you so much in advance.
