Using a throwaway account because my siblings haven't been told yet and I don't want them finding out on the internet, since they all use reddit. My Dad has been a hero for as long as I can remember - he helped take care of me the best he could after my Mom and her side of the family disowned me for being gay. My aunt called me today with the news and broke down crying. It makes me feel even worse knowing she has to call my other three siblings and repeat the process.

I'm just really numb, broke and hungry right now, and nothing would help me feel a little bit better right at this moment than a pizza, a pair of sweatpants, and a tv marathon.

I'll pay it forward as soon as I can to another hungry redditor.
