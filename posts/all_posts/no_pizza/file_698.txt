North Georgia Area here! Car was hit by a lady that ran a red light. Her husband was a cop.. Knew the cop at the scene... No witnesses stopped and i was out of luck. Im still trying to get in touch with someone that saw the wreck. Till then, i am for all intents and purposes broke till i know if i need to buy a whole new car or not...
