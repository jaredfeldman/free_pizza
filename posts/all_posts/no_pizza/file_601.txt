Hey redditors. I'm going to be hanging out with a couple of friends tonight and watching a movie. I've been off work sick for a while now and don't really have the spare cash for pizza currently. I'm not really struggling or starving. I just like pizza and haven't had any in a while. I would enjoy it greatly.
