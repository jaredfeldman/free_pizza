I do get paid tomorrow but my kind of out of food until then. The last remnants of my cash was in my wallet which I misplaced at the pride parade on Tuesday. 

To top off my lack of funds and food I already have to go through the painful and humiliating act of calling up my credit cards to have them cancelled, get a new drivers license/health card and much more =.=... Just down on my luck a bit and could use a pizza.

Thanks :].

Used a throwaway because I really would rather not have my friends/family know of my situation at the moment.. strange double standards I have I know. I won't get help from my friends or family but I'll ask strangers on the internet &gt;&lt;" I am willing to provide my actual account via pm :p
