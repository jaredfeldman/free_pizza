I shall do most anything in reason. I recently moved down here.. In the bumfuck middle of nowhere.  I live a stone's throw away from the Speedway.  I feel disconnected from the world.  I'm ACTUALLY looking forward to the meteor shower tonight-- as there's absolutely no light pollution around where I live.  Maybe enjoy it with a pizza? :)
