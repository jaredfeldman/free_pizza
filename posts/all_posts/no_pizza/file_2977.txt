I'm a disabled single mom &amp; my only son's birthday is this week.  Our house was vandalized last week &amp; w/ the power on, theives took all the wiring while we were away!  Neighbors called the police &amp; the thieves also took all of our appliances!  Anyway, my son's favorite thing to eat is pizzia!  They stole all his electronics &amp; games etc. &amp; I hope this will cheer him up!  God bless one &amp; all who donate to this awesome site! We are w/ friends in central FL now.
