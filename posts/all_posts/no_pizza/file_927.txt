I just found this site and I'm happy people actually send pizza. I'm really hungry and I have no food in the fridge. I just got back to my apartment tonight and I didn't eat dinner and I probably won't eat tomorrow either. My parents won't be able to give me money for a while. Can someone please help me with one of those EGIFT cards people give out? I can make some pizza last. I love Domino's. It's around the corner and the closest to me. So, hopefully when i wake up tomorrow I'll have some comments and a pizza by tomorrow night.
