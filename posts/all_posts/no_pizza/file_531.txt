I've never done this before, and I can't imagine anybody would give a stranger a free pizza. But why not give it a shot. 

I just want a night of greasy comfort food. Like I said, being sued for 50k, due to a bus accident I caused a year ago in which 14 people were injured (an honest mistake; it was raining, couldn't get out of the way in time, just spun in place). Insurance couldn't cover it all. Had to empty my bank account to pay for a lawyer, and on top of that I got laid off from my job a few months ago. Living with my parents again, and was almost able to move back out, until the accident. Back to square one.

I've always had problems with anxiety and depression, and this is really making me crumble. Had to stop seeing my therapist due to losing my insurance through my job (called some sliding scale clinics but not taking new patients). It would just be nice to eat some comforting pizza. But I can't afford much. 

Thanks for your consideration and for reading this. If you want proof of some kind I'll provide whatever you need; I know it sounds like kind of a fantastic run of bad luck.
