i'm a 22 year old part time college student (anthropology). alcoholic dad kicked me out last night. parents got divorced and can't stand my stepdad. this is so pathetic but my bank account is at zero and i have no cash. living off mcdonalds dollar menu for lunch.

quick edit: Hunger really makes you realize how much the world has to offer, and how little you have. got my verification code thing too.
