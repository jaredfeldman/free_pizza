My husband and I have been in a bad situation financially for...well....a long time. Personally, I haven't really been in a "good" financial situation my whole life. He hasn't been employed for over 2 years (except for a part time job he had for a little bit) and I worked full time to barely make ends meet. I got fired. We couldn't pay our bills to begin with. Pizza would be a great pick me up considering that our cupboards are bare and I've been waiting a month for my unemployment which STILL hasn't come in...and I still have no idea when they will decided I can have some money or even if I'm going to get anything...and April 8th was my birthday. I can't remember the last holiday that I have actually been able to celebrate with more than a "oh look at that its (my birthday, Chanukah, Valentines Day, Our Anniversary, etc.)...thats nice". I would really like to surprise my husband with a pizza. 
Thank you guys for even reading this, its good to know that there are good people out there who care about others. :) Hopefully my luck will improve (it better! its been years!) and I can return the favour.
