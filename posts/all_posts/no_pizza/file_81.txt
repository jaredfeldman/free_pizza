Hey reddit,

I'm a recent college grad from Virgina Tech, Go Hokies, with a degree in Accounting.  I'm currently sitting on almost $35000 in debt, and I don't know what to do.  I just checked my account and discovered I have $200 to my name. My rent is $950, all my bills are due and despite having sent out nearly 300 resumes in the past two months, I don't have a line on anything.

I'm not one to beg or look for handouts, but I'm sitting here, constantly refreshing my inbox and Monster.com, hoping and praying for some kind of job offer, and have decided to swallow my pride for at least the afternoon and see if this community's good heart and generosity would give me a helping hand.

I wish I could have come here on different terms, with me giving out free pizzas, but I swear as soon as I'm on my feet, I will return the favor for someone else in need.
