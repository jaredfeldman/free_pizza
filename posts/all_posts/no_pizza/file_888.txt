I hope I am doing this correctly. I do not have any  tear jerker story. Husband is working a double , children got their shots today and I would love to get pizza for them, it's not within our budget Thank you for taking the time consider my request We are a family of 5 but all i really care about if if the children are treated since they were quite brave. I will treat others to some pizza when my budget sees fit.
