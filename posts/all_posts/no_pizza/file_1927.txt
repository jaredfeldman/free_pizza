I did a summer abroad trip to Europe this year. Cool, right? I had to take out several private loans to cover expenses at home, like rent, while I was away. To make a long story short, my financial aid advisor boned me and only gave me above 66% of my private loan -- saying I had sufficient funds. I convinced my generous grandparents to loan me some money for my flight home. The cheapest I could find was a couple cities away. After eating nothing but bread and fruit the last several weeks and being couped up in this hostel all day I am finally going home tomorrow!!!! 

All I want is to go home and if I can get a nice American pie then thatd be great, too! It has been too long since Ive had a pizza! I live in Buffalo if that helps.
