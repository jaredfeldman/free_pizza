My girlfriend and I have been dating for six months today and I was being the guy I am and didn't get a gift. It turns out that she had gotten me a gift and I didn't get her one, even though we agreed on no gifts. So if anyone could help me out, that would be amazing. I promise to pay it forward when I get paid next week.
