Would love pizza for me and the family on Tuesday so I wouldn't have to heat up the kitchen making dinner! Having trouble with the wiring that runs the window A/C so can't run it during the day, it shuts down the breaker for the room; and while I was able to get out today and stay cool, tomorrow I will have to stay home &amp; cope. Thanks for reading!
