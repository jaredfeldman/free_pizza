For those of you so kind as to offer pizza for others, I ask that you perhaps consider sending a pizza to those at Occupy Wall Street.
https://occupywallst.org/  If you click on DONATE it will take you to their donations page.  About halfway down you can donate a pizza to them.  I'll paste the instructions they provided here as well.
