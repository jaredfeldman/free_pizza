I've been having such a down week worrying about my sick mother, being overloaded at work, how we'll be paying rent and upcoming bills, let alone food, for the next week...I would absolutely love some warm food to help tidy my growling stomach and my mind in the meantime.  Our pantry is bare and I have little $ to my name at the moment.

I'm located in California by the way  

I can PM you from my main account, I was just paranoid/ashamed because a simple google search provided much detailed information about me; I use that username all over the web..

Thank you, reddit~
