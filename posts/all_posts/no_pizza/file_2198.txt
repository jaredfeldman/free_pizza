I'm 23 years old, graduated from college this past december, when doing so I lost my on campus job. After that, I interned on a feature film for a month, meaning I worked at least 12 hours a day, for no pay. Since then, I've done my best to find a new job, but I live in a smaller, rural area, meaning there's not a whole lot of jobs to go around. This is my first post on this subreddit, but basically, I love pizza, and I would just love to eat. Thanks for reading.

EDIT: Just found out that because my mom was forced into early retirement, she has to pay $10,000 a year in income taxes for the next few years. So the $30 I have, is what I have.
