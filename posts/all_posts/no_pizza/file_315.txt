It's not about the food. I have dinner already made, so I won't be going hungry. I just think itll be funny watching what my parents do getting free pizza when we already ate dinner. If they'll take it out not, if they'll argue of what. Actually, if someone could get the pizza to arrive at like 9 or 10, it'll probably be even better. It doesn't even need to be pizza, just something, breadsticks maybe. Just something to make my parents wonder why there's summertime at our door at 10 o clock
