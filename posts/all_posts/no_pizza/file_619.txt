Hey guys, my roommate/partner in rhymes lost his job yesterday and I've been unable to find work for months.  We've no money (at all) for at least another few days and we're down to three potatoes.  These boys are heavily craving some za to break the monotony and lift our spirits a bit.
Thanks in advance to anyone wishing to send some good karma our way!
