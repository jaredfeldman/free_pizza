Too flippin hot outside to want to go anywhere (aka, i'm lazy). 
Coworkers will be like "Hey, where did you get the pizza?" and I'll be all like "Yo, some bad ass mofo inside my computa bought this fo me"

Or I could respond using proper English if you prefer. Or I could dance a jig and put a slice on my head.

edit: And now its POURING outside so I REALLY don't want to go anywhere.
