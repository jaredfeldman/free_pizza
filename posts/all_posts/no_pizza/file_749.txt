I just moved here (from Texas) to gain residency for BU. In the past month I've gotten hit by a car and broke my dominant wrist, got the flu, my upstairs neighbors flooded my living room making it unusable, my job won't let me work because of my cast, I couldn't afford school, my mom lost her job, the entire city flooded, and now the pipes in my kitchen are severly leaking so the repair guy turned off the water and have completely disassembled my kitchen. I can't use the water in my apartment for two days (that includes cooking....and my stove is currently in the living room too.) A pizza would be great :/
