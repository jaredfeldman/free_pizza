Hi, i am not going to lie to try to get something i don't deserve, i am not dieing, begging for food, etc. but rather just wanting to know if i could get a pizza, if there is someone in need of one that has a bad situation (no food, can't feed kids, etc.) give it to them, i'd rather see true joy/happiness then just being full myself.  I can't do much in return other than draw a picture or say something or something a 15 year old can do, i can give you a free copy of portal 1 if you want.

Thanks, and i hope this doesn't turn into a flame war or something.

EDIT: Sorry, I live in Eastern TN, where sharing Netflix is illegal &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
