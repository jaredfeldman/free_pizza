(Sorry, I didn't put my location in before)

Well, I had some unexpected finance troubles (who doesn't! ) and I'm out of luck (and have been for a couple days) food-wise until I get paid on Monday.
Whether or not this works, I'll be back next week to do this for someone!
Thanks in advance for reading and enjoy your weekend everyone! :)
