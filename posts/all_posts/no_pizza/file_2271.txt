So I'm enjoying the last days of unemployment (starting next Wednesday woo!) by setting a blanket outside with a pillow and a power strip long enough for me to take my laptop outside and a book (The Forever War). I'm not in particular need, but it's a gorgeous day, and I'm feeling like being a slug and it's my birthday tomorrow (me and my twin sister). Never done this before, not quite sure of the process. Again, not necessary at all and completely random! 

I love what you guys do here and will contribute once everything starts up. That being said, as far as random acts of cookies goes, someone motivate me to try out that recipe for key lime meltaways please! Also, let me know if there's any verification needed for anything. Or if there's any special procedure I should follow. If I do this, I want to do it right!
