I sprained my ankle (I have repeated problems with this ankle from a previous injury) and then I had to work at a cafe all day because it was my first day and I've been unemployed for a month so I can't afford to lose this new job that I finally found (I've been cleaning houses sporadically since I moved back to the city, and just scraping by). On top of that I passed my first kidney stone recently and I'm having landlord issues. I'm trying to stay optimistic but I just feel like I can't get a break lately.
