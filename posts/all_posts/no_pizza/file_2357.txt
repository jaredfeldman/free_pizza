I am a deployed soldier in Afghanistan and I am wanting to suprize my wife with a Pizza or something cool. I only have a few problems:

* Wife is visiting kinfolk in Harrisburg, AR which is a town of maybe 2000 with 1-2 mom and pop pizza places that may or may not be open today or tomorrow. one of these is [Checkers Pizza](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?rls=com.microsoft:en-us&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;startIndex=&amp;startPage=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=pizza+in+harrisburg,+arkansas&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=pizza&amp;hnear=0x87d437d6283197f9:0xa55b439652fb393a,Harrisburg,+AR&amp;cid=17044012131257561687)

* The only place with Chain Restaurants is 11-15 miles away in Jonesboro, AR and I am pretty sure they do not deliver. 

Anyone got any advice as to how I can hook them up. Just trying to find a unique way of telling my wife and kids I love them and miss them.
