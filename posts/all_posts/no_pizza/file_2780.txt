I am under no hardships. I'm just a 17-year-old kid living near Chicago, and I just think that my sister would be pleasantly surprised by a nice pizza. It's been a while since we've had to share something. ;)

Donors, if you're looking to help someone in need, look elsewhere. Although I'd like a pizza, I really don't *need* one, and there's plenty of requests on here that really do.

That being said, if you're still up for helping me be the coolest brother of the day, I live in Naperville, IL. 

Thanks!
