I just recently took a job opportunity, and finished out my two weeks at my previous employers. The overlap in training has left me with no money for my bills, my brother's wedding, or food. I'm kind of struggling and just seeing if anyone would like to lend a hand. I have lurked here for a while and will certainly pay the favor forward as soon as I get on my feet at the new job.
