kinda skint at the moment, no cigs, empty fridge and won't have any money until friday :( a pizza would really hit the spot and cheer me up :) I've been in this predicament before and have considered asking here but I've never found it easy asking for stuff, letting pride get in the way I suppose, will pay it back when I can.
