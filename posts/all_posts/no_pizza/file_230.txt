Today has sucked a lot.  Sitting alone in my apartment while my family goes on vacation - I need to stay available in case I need to go in for a second job interview, so I couldn't go.

Money's been tight.  I got Netflix recently and the free month just expired the other day.  Just by coincidence, my bank charged me an 8.00 monthly fee for being poor the day I signed up.  I thought it was Netflix charging me by mistake - but this brought my account pretty low, so when the charge for the first month hit, it resulted in overdraft.  Didn't know this until I called my bank.  So I got charged money for being poor...and then got charged more money for not having enough money, though I would have survived the second charge if not for the first.

Hope this doesn't come off as whiny.  I know other people have it way worse, and this is clearly a firstworldproblems kind of thing.  Still, it's only 12:30 and I'm lonely, depressed, and broke.  A pizza would go a long way toward lifting my spirits.

Edit:  Forgot a general location - I live in the U.S.; southern Louisiana, specifically.
