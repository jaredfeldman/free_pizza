I've been sick 3 out of 4 weeks this month and I'm hoping its not something serious. I've been out of work quite a bit this month (although I'm going back tomorrow) and haven't been able to get medicine because I have no health insurance! Anyway RAOP, can you help me out? I will pay it forward next paycheck (on the 25th, since my paycheck on the 11th will barely be there). Thanks in advance! Whether I get pizza or not this subreddit is a great thing! :)
