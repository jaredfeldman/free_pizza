This weekend my vehicle took a poop and now its a 1200 dollar repair to get my car fixed. I cant afford that for a whole month and on top of that, I go into work today and they tell me at the end of the month I will be let go from the company because of budget cuts. Single man with a little puppy to feed, got dog food, but a pizza would really bring my spirits up for today.
