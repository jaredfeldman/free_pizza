I've been out of a job for 3 weeks. I've been doing random jobs in the neighborhood to help pay rent. I did land a new job. The only issue is it doesn't start until August (then 2 weeks til my first check). The last pizza I had was one of those Jack's (cardboard things). 

Despite having several "flavors" Ramen Noodles are getting old. I don't know what else to say. I'm new to this.

Thanks for reading.
