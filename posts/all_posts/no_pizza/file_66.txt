I am tired of ramen and anything that comes out of can. I'm really hoping someone can hook me up, because I only have a dollar to my name. I wasn't able to budget well this past month as I had to get my car repaired. $558.00 for repair took what was left of my check and cleared out my savings. I am broke till next Friday and desperately hoping for some pizza. I live in Frankfort, NY. Thank you for reading.
