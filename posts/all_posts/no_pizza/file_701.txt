No sob story here i'm afraid folks and i'm a guy so no tales of how i'm on my own in bed wearing a tiny pair of pants (does that ever work?) I'm not really expecting anything to be honest

Just got my first car (Peugeot 106 1.1 liter!) which came to £450 and the insurance which came to £1500 for the year, i only passed my test a couple of days ago at the fourth attempt (so hang in there anyone still doing it.. So worth it!) basically i haven't got a penny to my name and i'm suffering a touch of buyers remorse but man i love driving 

Hope everyone's having a good day! If anyone's in the UK, did you hear that thunder?! Awesomeeeeee
