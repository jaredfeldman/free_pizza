I just moved got a place with my friend! Excited but at the same time it doesn't leave much in the bank if you know what I mean. Its been the first of the month and we have budgeted well and used our resources sparingly. It is now almost near the end of our journey and we find our selves on the couch wondering how many cup of noodles have we eaten? Frankly, I can stick it out and so can my friend.... but it would be awesome to eat something that's not SOUP! :) me and my friend would appreciate anything
