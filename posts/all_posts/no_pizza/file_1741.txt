 I just started a new job about a week ago, and I have .62 cents in my bank account. Luckily I bought a bus pass to get me to and from work before I ran out of money. I'm finally getting up on my feet but right now is the hardest time for me. I would be homeless if not for my best friends parents who took me in. Please, it would really help me out... I know I can make a pizza last at least a few days. Anything helps out in these times.
