I'm not new to Reddit. I often look through posts on this subreddit wondering if it's okay to post from my main account or not. I decided against it and I hope that doesn't scare anyone away. The kids and I had pb&amp;j (peanut butter and jelly for the uninitiated) for breakfast and we are now debating our options. We are not without food, but would just like something different. A pizza would definitely help us forget about our breakfast. PB&amp;J is great, but eating it day after day gets old. I hope someone will please consider us. Any pizza place would work, the little ones and I can share a pizza. Thank you.
