THIS GUY!! I was gonna do a weird punchline involving some kind of cuddly animal, but then I realized most animals don't have thumbs...or do they...? Anyways I'm going to be honest here, I really am hungry; totally famished, and I've been listening to my stomach growl since I've woken up. Basically I'm waiting for school to start so I can receive my financial aid in order to purchase books and more importantly FOOD. Unfortunately that isn't for another 2 weeks....which has kind of left me in a desperate situation. Hence the RAOP request. For those wary gifters out there I know...this is a new account and thus this request will probably be treated as a scam but I assure you that I am indeed a real live hungry college student. Starving, some might say, stupid as well for hoping $150 could buy me a months worth of food, but alas, a man can dream. Anyways, a pizza or a gift card would really go a long way; a gift card more so because I would stave off hunger as long as possible, but any food right now would be fantastic and I would really appreciate the help. Well, thanks for reading.
