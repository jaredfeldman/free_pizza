My mom's Gallbladder removal was supposed to be a routine procedure but ended up being twice the size of an ordinary one so removing it was a complicated procedure. Once it was out she was left with a giant scar and is now in a bunch of pain she even attempts to get up and walk around leaving me the responsibility to do everything around the house. It's been about a week and I've been able to magically make whatever we had left but now I'm running out of money and energy. So if you can please let me know, Thanks.
