I was supposed to get paid for tutoring this week, but my student got a speeding ticket and paid that first. 
A pizza would feed us for the next couple of days, and I would weep with relief if we got some help.
I also have hypothyroidism, and going hungry can be really difficult for me.
If you give me your address, I will send you a thank you card in return, and I will write your name/username in Arabic for you, if you want.
