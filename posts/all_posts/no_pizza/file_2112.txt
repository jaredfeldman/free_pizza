At the start of the month my car broke down. I came back two days later and it was stolen. Cant afford a new one but saving my butt off. Work doesnt pay nearly enough and i have only a couple of pennies to my name till friday but im happy i have a job. Just got off work and only ate a pb j sandwich for lunch and im starving, but sick of living off ramen and pb j for a week. Any offer would be greatly appreciated.
