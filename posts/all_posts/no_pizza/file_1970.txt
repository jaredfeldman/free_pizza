I moved away from home a little over a year ago to be with my husband. I have four younger sisters and my family is very close, so this was tough for all involved, but we keep in touch, and not a day goes by when I don't talk to at least one of my siblings via Steam or Facebook. I just missed an IM from my little sister lamenting that another week is going by, and my family hasn't got the money for food right now. She was upset because their pets are hungry, and that all she'd had for lunch was a piece of bread. I feel awful about this, but I'm not really in a position to do anything about it myself. Making matters worse, I thoughtlessly made a comment on Facebook earlier today, complaining about all the leftovers in my fridge, and wishing that my sisters were around to help. How I must have made them feel upon reading that puts me near tears.

Their financial situation is complicated and I don't want to get into detail, because it's not my place to talk about their problems in a public forum. Suffice it to say, they're going through a rough patch, but if someone would be so kind as to provide them a hot meal, I hope that a random act of kindness would help them feel better about life in general. I've been where they are, and I know how low it makes a person feel not being able to afford food. 

Here's my favourite picture of me and my siblings and our dogs, taken about a decade ago:
