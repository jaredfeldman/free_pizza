So I'm chilling at home right now playing some League of Legends, and for this week apparently my timesheet hadn't switched from "Temporary EMployee" for working over the summer over to the regular "Student" pay, semester has started. No pay for this week and am craving some pizza! Anyone wanna help a brother out? Willing to gift a champion or skin in return :)
