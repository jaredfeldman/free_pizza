Hey redditors, I'm a starving artist and shooting a short film on Sunday, February 3rd with a bunch of other local starving artists.  There will be about 20 hungry people in a cold and drafty warehouse building in Bristol, PA.

We've got a thank you or provided by credit available to anyone willing to share a slice.

Thanks!
