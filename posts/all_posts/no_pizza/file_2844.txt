dear seattlites, and even those who live far away, I ask you just for one second of your time. I swear it wont take long, and I swear I wont ask much. All I'm pleading with you for, is a nice hot vegetable/meat covered sweet sensation bringing belly filling pizza pie. We are a house of 4 friends who due to unlucky circumstances have found ourselves jobless and on the verge of losing our home. This is all we ask, is for some food for our stomachs so we may have energy when setting out on our quest and turning in resumes. Our sweet loving dog Oliver has begun to suffer as we have resorted to eating his dog food and his supply is slowly dwindling. Please dearest humans with money in your pockets, dearest humans with food on your table, share your wealth and increase our health. Love surely, the inhabitants of the house on the corner.
