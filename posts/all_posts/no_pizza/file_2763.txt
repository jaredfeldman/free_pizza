my bff showed me reddit and its a really cool site.
i just broke up with my fiancee last night cuz he was cheating on me.  i also think i broke 2 of my toes when i got back home last night. they reeeaaally hurt.  im broke until pay day and i'm really down in the dumps with all of this. id love to eat a pizza while i watch with a league of their own tonight.
