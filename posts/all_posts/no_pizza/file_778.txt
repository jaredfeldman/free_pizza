Hi all, thanks for taking the time to even look at a request on here.

So the story is I've been unemployed since I got out of the Air Force and doing pretty okay without unemployment benefits. But I've started my new job and its a 20 mile drive both ways and not exactly conducive to my 50 dollar a week income from selling plasma. To top it off, today I was moved to a 8-5 shift and couldn't make it in time to donate due to traffic.

I won't get paid until next Friday, which will be kind of a stretch. Not looking for anything major, just hoping for a nice random act to keep me full until tomorrow afternoon.

And I guess to guilt you guys a bit, my new job is providing network support to literally EVERY Army hospital in the world and keeping their gears turning. To say the least, it is stressful.

But that's that, thought I might try one of these. Thanks for reading :D
