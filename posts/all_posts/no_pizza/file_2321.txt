So, I wouldn't ever think to actually do something like this, and I don't post that often.  But I'm hungry and just about of money and getting very tired of ramen, beans and rice, and ham sandwhiches. The fact that my girl left me this morning makes me even more desperate. (She usually cooks my dinner) If there's anyone out there that could help a fellow redditor you could bring a lot of help to sad soul.

Thanks in advance to anyone kind enough.
Will post pics of the pizza and my happy face enjoying them :)
