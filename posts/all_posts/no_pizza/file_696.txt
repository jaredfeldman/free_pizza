Dear reader,

I would really love to eat pizza on a special occasion like Halloween since I haven't eaten pizza for several months now. It might be a strange request to send a pizza to Japan but it would make me so happy. 

I found an English guide for the Japanese Pizza Hut site.

It would really help me a lot and I wouldn't mind sending you a Japanese postcard back. (they also have pok√©mon postcards here)

Thank you in advance for all the trouble to be taken.
