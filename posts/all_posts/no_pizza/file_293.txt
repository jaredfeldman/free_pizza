My mother and I have been rather down on our luck; paying phone, rent and credit card bills has left us with almost no funds at all and the both of us have been wanting a simple cheese pizza but with no way to pay for it. It would be really wonderful if someone could spare a pizza for the both of us. We're in New York City. Thanks so much if you can. :)
