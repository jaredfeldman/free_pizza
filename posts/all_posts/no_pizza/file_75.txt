Hey guys,

I'm a student at a pretty good university where most students are pretty financially stable. Unfortunately, that's not the case for me. I get some scholarships that help a lot, but thanks to some discrepancies I won't see any money for a couple of days. My mother is a single mom going through some financial issues because of some hospital bills and I can't bear to ask her for some cash and burden her further. So I'm turning to this subreddit in hopes of getting some warm food for tonight.

If by some random chance of fortune someone throws some food my way I'll be sure to return the favor once my scholarship money clears through.

Thanks guys
