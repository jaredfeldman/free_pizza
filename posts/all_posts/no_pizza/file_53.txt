Hi RAOP redditors,

I recently moved up to Kirkland, WA, and due to less than happy circumstances had to move my wife up when our finances were less than ideal in order to get her out of them. While the hope was to move her up when our finances were more stable, it just didn't pan out that way.

The good news is that it meant I got to be with her sooner. The bad news is that it's meant having no money for much food at all - in fact, we ran out of food this evening. We're waiting on some sales on craigslist to get through and see us through the weekend, but it doesn't look like those will happen tonight.

I would be deeply grateful if the pizza fairy made its visit tonight, and so here is my story. Thank you.
