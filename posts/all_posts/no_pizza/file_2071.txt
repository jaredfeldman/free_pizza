So this isn't quite the usual post but me and my friends broke out the old N64 tonight and were playing some Harvest Moon, we had gotten as far as building the second story to our house when my N64 shut off!! and now it won't even boot back up... we're totally bummed out, and if any of you guys know how we feel, we'd love a pizza right now. Thanks in advance
