Due to shitty circumstances and misinformation I missed dinner at the dining hall tonight.  The express option was not available due to "spring cleaning".  Me and twelve other unhappy campers got shafted.....  Also, it was wing night at the express dinner.....  Double wut-ze-fuck....

Anywho, I realized that I also have like $3.83 in my bank account until tomo, so if someone would like help me out that would be amazing!! :)))))
