I saw a pizza cut into a Triforce over on r/gaming and I thought it was really awesome. That got me hungry for pizza so I looked all over for my Topper's Pizza stickers so I could get a free pizza because i am frugal but I only had 8 of 10 stickers. So if a person would be kind enough to buy me a random pizza, I would be very glad and then you would be my reddit friend.

Optional: getting the pizza cut into a Triforce.

Also, I am an Ent and I love all you Ents out there. [4]
