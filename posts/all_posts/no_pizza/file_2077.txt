My Birthday is this friday (November 16th) and I'm turning 21! :D I'm extremely excited! I've been browsing Reddit all evening and I randomly got the idea! /r/RandomActsOfPizza was what originally brought me to Reddit for the first time; just the amount of awesomeness involved is unlike anything else I've seen. I've never actually had a good enough reason to post here (other than having the munchies) but now I think I do! It'd make my 21st birthday awesome!
