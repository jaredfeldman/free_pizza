Single mom in central Pennsylvania looking for some help. I only have enough food in the house for my children. I don't have any money right now. I always make sure they have what they need, even if I have to go without. I am getting grocery money on Friday. I would really appreciate a pizza to help lift my spirits. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
