My boyfriend had to go to the ER a few days ago and I got behind on laundry so I'm already going to have to turn on the dryer and heat the house up more. We have a portable AC in one room but it's working hard today and I'm still rather miserable. I also had my first encounter with morning sickness this morning and I hate touching/looking/smelling raw meat lately so a nice pizza that I dont have to turn the oven on for sounds so great right now. Thanks for reading/considering!
