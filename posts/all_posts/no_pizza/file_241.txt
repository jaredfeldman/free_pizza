Hi all, 

We just moved across Canada and are moving into our new place here in Edmonton, Alberta. Long story short, the movers completely botched our move and we are not getting our property for another week. The move has been tough on us financially and emotionally, we could use a break. Wondering if anyone out there wants to send some pizza over our way. We will return the favour in two weeks once we get settled into our new place.
