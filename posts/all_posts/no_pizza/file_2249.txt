Anything to eat. My gf and i are house sitting. Have no food or money. We get paid on saturday for the house sitting.. We dont want to eat the food of the house and cannot get a hold of the house owners to ask. My check is a day late. My company can be shaky with paying on time. (Direct deposit) Today is honestly the worst timing yet. I humbly ask to my fellows members of the internet. I am about to tell her the bag of pop corn we ate IS our Thanksgiving.
