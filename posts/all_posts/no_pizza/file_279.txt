Hey guys, I'm a college student in Richmond and it's a couple days before I move into my new place. I'm trying to save up money so I can be independent from my parents, who haven't really offered support unless they can use it to their advantage... Anyway, a pizza my way would be much appreciated, and once I start my full time job I'll try to pay it forward.

Thanks!
