The title says it all - We don't really have a sob story, other than to say that we're poor and neglected to take something out of the freezer to thaw for dinner tonight.  It's cold outside, and we'd be grateful for some cheesy goodness.  Thanks!

edit: We can pay it forward Friday. Could probably even come with a contest to do so...
