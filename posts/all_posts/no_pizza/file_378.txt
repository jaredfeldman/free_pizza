Hey Reddit! This is my first post ever on here. I've been a lurker for almost a year now but I'm not much of a talker in general. I have two girls 6 and 9. I support them on my own and make sure they have everything they need. Here's the issue. [Paypal is holding all my cash](http://i.imgur.com/HeyOJ.jpg), as per usual. I wasn't expecting it to be held this long. However I'm almost 100% positive it will be released Monday or Tuesday. If someone could help out me out, I can send you $5 now and the rest once it is released. Tonight we are fine but tomorrow we will have nothing left. My mother is coming down Sunday to lend me some groceries until the money get's transferred to my bank account. I can give you any information needed. I'm not asking for handouts, I will pay it back.
