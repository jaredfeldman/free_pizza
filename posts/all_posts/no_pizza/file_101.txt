I would be so grateful to anyone, if they could help me out with a pizza. Other than the last piece of bread, I've been without food for 2 days. 

When people look in their fridge, or pantry, and say "there's no food!" usually there is a lot of food, just not food they want to eat. If you look into my fridge and pantry, you will see some butter, some cooking oils, and a bit of milk. 

Le sigh. ;.;

I live in Canada.
