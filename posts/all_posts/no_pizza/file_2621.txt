Hey Reddit. This is my call in hope to get something warm to eat today.
This morning I locked myself out of my flat. It is really cold here and my flatmate will come home in at least 7 hours... when he arrives, all the shops here will be closed so my plan of buying dinner just disappeared. I went to my university so at least i will not freeze to death. Maybe someone of you can make my day a little bit better.
