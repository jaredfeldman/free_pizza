Hey RAoP. Long-time lurker; first-time poster.

My situation requires something kind of long-term, which I don't really expect to find online (I don't want to be over-reliant on the community; you guys are great) but which I hope to... figure out fairly soon. I'm disabled; receiving assistance which is pretty inadequate -- in the process of applying for more.

Anyway, all of that aside, a pizza'd go a long way toward bridging the gap this month. I'd sincerely appreciate it.
