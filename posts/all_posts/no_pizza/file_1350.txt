My debit card overdrew last night, and there's very little to eat here besides rice and corn tortillas. I'll have money on Monday, but I'd like to just eat something with flavor tonight.

Edit: I should have specified, I was hoping for just a cheese pizza from pizza hut or dominos. If you're feeling especially generous, a stuffed crust would be magical.
