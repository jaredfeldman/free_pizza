Ok so today is his birthday and we have no money to throw him a party or celebrate it. I am 17 and he just turned 21!!! We live with my dad but unfortunately he doesn't have any money either. I would really appreciate it if someone would gift him a pizza and I'm sure he would be delighted. Thanks for taking the tome to read this and if you decide to help me out then I will be grateful. I have no proof unless you want to add him on facebook. I live in Sugarland, Texas
