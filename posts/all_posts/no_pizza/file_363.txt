Hi Redditors,
My name is Tom Maxwell and I'm coming to you to ask for a favor. I'm 16-years old and living in Seattle for two months to participate in a summer business program. Long story short, I have $1.86 in my bank account and my parents don't get paid until Saturday (they're paid every other Saturday). What I'd really like is a small pizza to get me through the night, and I'll answer any other questions you may have (within reason, for privacy reasons obviously).
Thanks
