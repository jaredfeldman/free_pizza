Hey there Reddit, I've been working on a art request thread over [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/nxily/offer_art_student_in_dire_need_of_practice_ill/)  But my roommate and I would love some pizza, but can't spend money on it since we're saving for our next semester that starts Monday.  One of my roommates books is $200 D:  and I just need to get tons of supplies.  

To whoever buys us a pizza from pizza hut, we'll draw you what ever you want!  Or we'll draw you tons of cats, what ever you want!  (We're also saving for a cat)

We're in Grand Rapids, Mi if that helps anyone.  

We shall wait here playing Links awakening, and don't worry if you don't buy us any - go buy pizza for someone that really hungry.  We're just bored and would appreciate a pizza.
