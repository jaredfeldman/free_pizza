Hey there, RAOP!

I'm new to this subreddit and figured I'd put up a request since I have a tough couple days ahead of me. 
I have exams in both of my 400-level classes on Monday and I'd really appreciate a pizza to get me through all the dense reading I have to do!
In one of my classes we're learning about altruistic behavior in humans, so a pizza gift from a random Internet stranger would be especially appropriate food for thought ;) 

Have a great weekend, everybody!
