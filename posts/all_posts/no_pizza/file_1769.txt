I just paid the last of my bills, and now have 3 dollars in my wallet. I wont be getting any more money for at least 5 more days, and currently have 2 packets of mac and cheese to eat. Not exactly sure what I'm going to do, my stomach is really starting to hurt from not eating. I feel pretty weird asking for food like this but I love this whole operation. I'd promise to pay it forward soon as I am able!

I'm in Westwood, CA...
