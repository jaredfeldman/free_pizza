i was driving on the highway when the driver behind me lost control of his f150, as i was slowing down to get off the exit, all i hear is a lound shriek, and everything turned black. i woke up, looked around and was just amazed at how i was still alive. anyway i dont have a car anymore, lucky to be alive. THe other driver was ok too. Anyway i would appreciate anyone from the reddit community who would like to help cheer me up with a slice...or two.
