I'm off work and uni with glandular fever which has caused badly swollen glands and is making me look like the elephant woman (can prove with pictures) :( I'm craving a pizza and just can't afford one right now, got no food in the house and too tired to get out of bed to walk and get something to eat.

Edit: Will try pay it forward when I can!
