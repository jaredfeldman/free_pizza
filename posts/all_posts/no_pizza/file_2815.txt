After a long and last-minute move out of our apartment into a new apartment that we really can't afford (long story), we accidentally kicked a hole in the drywall while moving our last boxes. 

Bit of panic later, the girlfriend is currently ZipCar-ing to Home Depot to try to find parts before they close. I told her I would get food--but little does she know I only have $38 in my bank account until **next** Monday. http://i.imgur.com/ceUN6Ht.png

TL;DR - My dumb little sob story. :-/
