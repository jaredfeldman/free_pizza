Hey everybody,

My band and I are from Chicago, and we are in week two of our 5 week tour. The 6 of us have nowhere to stay tonight in southern Oregon so we pooled our money to get a hotel room. Since we have no show today we don't have a venue to provide us food, so a hot meal would be much appreciated. In return, we have merch to offer you or we could send you the digital download of our debut album. 

We would be more than grateful for any help, our moms are worried we aren't getting enough to eat. Seriously.
