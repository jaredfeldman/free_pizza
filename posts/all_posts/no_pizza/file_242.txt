This is a throwaway account because my family and friends are redditors. 

I have been having a hard time lately and don't know what to do. My
girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me recently, my dad passed away, my depression is getting to me, I'm failing 2 college classes, and I just lost my job. I know this subreddit isn't for begging but I just want a pizza to help clear my mind off of things. I know its not much but winning a pizza would actually make me a little bit happy. If you would be so kindly as to give me a pizza then I would be thankful. I live with 2 other people in a dorm room (if that matters) in Houston, Texas. Thank you for taking the time to read this post and have a good day. I know there are a lot of scammers on this subreddit so if no one comments or gifts me a pizza then no worries. I will gladly repay this favor when I get the chance to. God bless you and thanks for reading this.
