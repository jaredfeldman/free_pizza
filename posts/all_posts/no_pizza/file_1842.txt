Not quite sure how this works.. This is the first New Year I will be without any company. I think there are about 4 other guys living on my floor, but I don't know them. Of course, I can't finish an entire pie by myself so I would love to share with them as well! 

I'm here on campus to get some work done before the new semester starts. For the past few meals I have been subsisting on just rice water. In return, I can offer a (poorly) drawn on Paint picture of your request! If you could help, it would be really appreciated. Thanks and Happy New Years to everyone!
