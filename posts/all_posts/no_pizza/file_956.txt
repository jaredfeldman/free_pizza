So this is my roommate and my last night living together, we will both be going home which is about 3-4 hours apart. We've been friends since middle school and probably wont be able to hang out anymore (at least for a long time). We both recently left our jobs (I helped him get one on campus where I work). I worked their for 2 years and he worked there for a year. It would be nice to commemorate our final night of living together.
