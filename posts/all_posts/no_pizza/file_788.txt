There's a bunch of people around here who actually need a pizza 'cause they don't have food or whatever. So if you're looking to give, get to them first.


I've been depressed for quite a while now, give or take 4 years, mainly due to the pressure from my family to go to college and get a degree. I've messed up quite a bit during that time, all of it my fault honestly, and so I've gotten academically suspended for a year. This has escalated my depression because I feel like I'm just throwing away opportunities like it's nothing and letting everyone I know down. Today's been especially bad, I had a pretty shitty dream were everyone finds out what I failure I am, the first thought I had today was about suicide. I know I wont do anything, but it's still an awful way to start my day. So I've been drinking the day away and being generally useless. 

Sorry for the boring story but it just feels better to type it out. It's not like I'm lacking food, I could go make a sandwich, but a pizza would be nice since I don't have the money for that.
