Just heard about this and rather than request a pizza for myself I thought how fun would it be for a surprise pizza to show up for the Adoption and Lifesaving staff at the animal control shelter I volunteer with several times a week.  Its a rainy and miserable day, the shelter is extremely overcrowded meaning the days are stressful and filled with tough decisions being made for space.  I wouldnt want them to know its from my request but just a random act of Pizza sent there way for all their hard work.  
The staff are there until 8pm Eastern time.  Im actually headed over to walk some dogs this evening and would love to see them enjoying a surprise pizza :)    Even if we cant make it happen tonight..maybe another night/afternoon this week.  
Pizza can always make a bad day a little better!
