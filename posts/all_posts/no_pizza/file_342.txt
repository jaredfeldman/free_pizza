Hey! Just got off my retail job that im working until i finish my teaching certification (hs math/physics). 

Been eating peanut butter sandwiches for a few days now until i get paid at the end of the week.

Would really appreciate it and would repay the favor soon!

Thank you! May The Flying Spaghetti Monster grace you with his noodly appendage!
