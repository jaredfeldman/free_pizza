My father just recently was a wealthy man with a high paying job at a bank, but because he took a loan from a client he got fired. My step-mom is jobless, filing for bankruptcy, and I work at McDonalds to have my own money. Unfortunately, I've been screwed over twice in the same day yesterday... My paycheck only clocked me for 8 hours where I deserved to be clocked 16, and the bank would absolutely not allow me to deposit or cash my check. So that leaves me without GTA V(which I had planned to buy yesterday), as well as without money in general. I had planned to buy a large pizza to share with my friends while we played GTA V but now none of that is possible. My friend brought his hard copy over to my house, and so now I request a random act of pizza be given to us. Note: This isn't a sob story, this is just a request so please don't feel guilty if you don't want to give us pizza. I have cereal. 

TL;DR Wasn't able to get GTA V or pizza, so I'm asking for a random act of pizza. Much appreciated.
