Hey out there in pizza land.  We are a family of 6 with a 3 week old.  It is 100 degrees and we have no AC.  The baby has been crying because it is just too hot for him.  I can't possibly turn the stove on tonight, if we could get out of this house and go grab a pizza somewhere, all the kids would really appreciate it tremendously.  Thanks to all who inhabit this site!
