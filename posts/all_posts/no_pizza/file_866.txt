My kids &amp; my friend's kids are having a sleepover Friday night at my house. I'd love to treat them to a couple of pizzas since it's a rare treat for all of them. I'm unemployed &amp; my friend is on SSI. If anyone would like to help the kids would be thrilled! It's their last sleepover before school starts.
