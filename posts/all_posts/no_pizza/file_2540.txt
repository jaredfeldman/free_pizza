Long story short: I am a British student who is now living in Canada and have been the past 11 months. I  recently lost my job at a youth hostel in downtown Toronto (also where I live) and for the past 2 weeks I have struggled desperately to get a replacement job but to no avail. With rent coming, phone bill to pay, and other assortments, I'm stressing. Hard.

I've never had to ask people for handouts, and I really don't know how to go about asking, so I'll just say it.

I would like a pizza Reddit. I have absolutely no cash left and I have barely and food left in my fridge; the past 3 days I have survived on water from the tap, peanuts and microwavable popcorn.

It's a joke, really, and I am ashamed. I have been a long-time lurker and never actually thought I'd create an account solely for this purpose.

Apologies, but help is appreciated.

Proof if required.
