I am exhausted after work, and hungry, however, I spent the last of my money buying Reddit gold for people the other night. That's my own fault though. Anyways, if you're in a pizza giving mood, I'm in a pizza receiving mood. Also, does anyone know how to make an X-mas present seamless when wrapping it? It keeps buckling..

Edit: Don't need it anymore! Roommate came home with that Little Caesars!
