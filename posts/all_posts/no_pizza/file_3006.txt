I have this week alone to make up all the work I have missed. I have just lost one of my cats to liver disease and I miss him alot. He was only 2 years old. Midterms are next week and I have to study along with getting my work in. A redditor giving me a pizza will make my week and make me work even harder. I will also take requests for things to do in return. Thank you! (I live in Ypsilanti, Michigan)
