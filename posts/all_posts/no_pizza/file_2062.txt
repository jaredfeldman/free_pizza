Hi Reddit,

I've been a long time lurker of your FUU memes through my friend's links. I'm reaching out to you since I  moved to nyc this summer to start grad school and can barely afford living here, let alone cover my expenses. I've been living off Ramen noodles and PB&amp;J sandwiches for the past 2 months and could really use a pick me up.
