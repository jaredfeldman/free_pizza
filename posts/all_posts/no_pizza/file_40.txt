I don't like asking others for help, but it's been 2 days and I'm so very hungry. I had no choice but to ask.

I would really appreciate anything anyone can do to help, and I will happily pay it forward once I get paid in the next couple of days. I will also make sure to post a big, fat Thank You post to whomever does me this great kindness.

Thanks!

EDIT: roommate came through! No longer needed. Thx!
