We're two students that have packed up all of our belongings to go home, all of our money was used cleaning our dorm rooms (our electric meter has run dry  and there's nothing for us to eat until we leave tomorrow evening.  Please help us my stomach is making sounds like an erupting volcano :(. 

We're currently based in Kent, which is in southeast England for reference, and will PM email address or whatever necessary if anyone would be so kind as to help us out. &lt;3

We'll be more than happy to return the favour when we're in more a advantageous situation.

Thanks guys.
