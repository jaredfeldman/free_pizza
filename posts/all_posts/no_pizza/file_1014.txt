I just moved in to my new place (loving it!) last night. I'm in a bit of a bind since I was previously living in a mix of hotels/couches, and don't have anything to cook with, just my clothing and a few other necessities for now. All the money I had saved up went to my rent and security deposit. I get paid on Monday but until then the food situation is looking a bit grim. I send my thanks in advance to anyone who'd like to help me get through the next day with the cheesy goodness of pizza!
