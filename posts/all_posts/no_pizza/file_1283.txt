I just came back from vaction, now I'm broke. This has put a damper on my plan to lure Batman to my house to learn his ways. There are 4 people who live here and I am trying to get enough pizza to feed them and, with any luck, attract the Dark Knight himself to join in the festivities. I have requested pizza on this site before and have recieved a gift card. But at the time I couldn't use it so I donated it to someone else who needed it more than I did (not unlike the Caped Crusader would have done). I would be grateful for any help.
