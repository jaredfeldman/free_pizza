Girlfriend of 9 months just broke up with me, turns out she slept with a guy after a night out 2 weeks ago. Had a feeling she had as everything was different (No intimacy etc) and today she told me on the phone, she leaves for Thailand tomorrow (She's an English teacher going out there for a year)

I live with my parents and they've all gone to another family members 21st birthday, didn't really feel like going but now I massively regret it, just sat here in the house with no one to talk to/vent except our mangy old cat.

Would really appreciate something to smile about.
