Greetings all. This is a brilliant subreddit, and deserves all the attention it's been getting. Anyways; I'm stuck at work until 5PM. I don't have a lunch, nor the money for it (my paycheck isn't until next week). Any kind folks out there willing to trade a pizza IOU? Will definitely be returning the favor next week.
