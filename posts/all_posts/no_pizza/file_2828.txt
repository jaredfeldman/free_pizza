He's always looked out for me and I would like to return the favor. He came home as a surprise to us which is great, but i can't celebrate because my girlfriend, son, and myself are going to be moving to a new apartment next month so we're on a very tight budget. We live near Pizza Hut and Domino's. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

I would be more than willing to provide proof in any way possible.
