There is a Papa Johns right near us and I have a 50% off code if you'd like to use it. I looked and the total for the Pizza we would like would end up being $11.66 with the coupon.

More Info:  I started a new job on Friday and we get paid every other week, starting next week (so I'll only get paid for one day on my first paycheck on 9/7).  We have about $1080 in our checking account and rent ($1050) comes out within the next couple of days.  Husband won't get paid again until 9/14.  

As for proof, I can take a screenshot of our bank account balance and a couple of past rent deductions from the account so you can see the amount and them coming out the first of the month.  I can also show where he got paid on Friday.
