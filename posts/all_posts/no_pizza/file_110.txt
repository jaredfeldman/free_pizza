I didn't know there was a place on the internet where you could even make a request like this. Reddit is truly amazing and the people here are so nice. I find myself getting lost in threads, especially about memes, iama, and askreddit. I have to admit, I browse more than I make actual responses because I usually don't have the time to sit down and type out a response.           

So today I find myself with nothing important to do. I slept in, cleaned up the place, went for a walk and came back with nothing to do. Even the programs on tv aren't that entertaining. I have a choice between Keeping up with the Kardashians and Pregnant and Dating. No thank you. I think I'll keep the tv off for now.         

I would greatly appreciate something random and delicious, since my Saturday has been pretty ho hum so far.  Nothing fancy, but I would totally dig a cheese pizza. I would be so grateful if someone would be willing to treat me to some pizza tonight. Thank you.
