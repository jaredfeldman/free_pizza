Hey RaoP, first time posting here, but I've seen this and other "Random Acts of ..." threads before. As the title says, I'm a down-on-his-luck post-graduate living paycheck-to-paycheck, and these past few days have been hard on me. I can't really afford groceries until my next paycheck, walk seven miles a day to/from work (cumulative, not each way), can't afford lunch so I don't break for it, and I would really just love to sit down after a long day and stuff my face with some hot, cheesy, saucy goodness (also, I'd get to have the leftovers for lunch!). Anyway, if a kind redditor can help out I would greatly appreciate it, and if not, that's perfectly fine too.
