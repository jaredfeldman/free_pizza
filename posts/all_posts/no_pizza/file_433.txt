I have less than 2 dollars in each of my accounts right now.  The government of Kentucky takes out more money from me during the summer from my small stipend because I am not taking classes.  I still have to do my research/work.  I do not want to ask my parents for money as I'm 25 and I hate doing that.  I just saved some money on my car insurance but that doesn't come into effect until next month.  I'm barely getting by and have had about a coffee and a granola bar today.  Please someone save me!
