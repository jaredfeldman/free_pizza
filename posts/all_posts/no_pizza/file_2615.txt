So my truck was stollen from my car port last night :(. An 88 Toyota Pickup. Why anyone would want it is a mystery to me. Probably just stoll it for parts and tires. Anyhoo, it's shitty and I think a nice pizza would cheer me up and make the research I need to do to find a new (new to me :)) vehicle a little easier to deal with.
