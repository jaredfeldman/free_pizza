Just finished up the last of my classes and running low on funds. Looking for full time employment now that summer started to support myself.

In the mean time I am getting a bit hungry and could use a pizza,  anything would do. I made a throw away so my friends/family don't know my financial situation at the moment because I really hate asking for handouts. Im willing to provide my actual account via pm and repay the favor to you or set uo my own offer once I'm working full time.

Thank you for your timw
