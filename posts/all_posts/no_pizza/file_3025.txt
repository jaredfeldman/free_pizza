I just arrived back at school after visting my family in Wisconsin over the holidays. Unfortunately while I was there I ran in to some pretty serious car problems and a hefty bill. Paying for my car so I could make it back to school cost everything in my bank account (and a couple hundred dollars my parents were able to help me with ): ). Now I'm at my appartment with nothing to eat and could really use a pie to tide me over untill class starts monday and I get my financial aide. Thanks
