Planning a cross-country move in a week (Davison, Michigan to Maine), but currently broke and living on ramen and occasionally my roommates' leftovers. I would seriously appreciate a break from that, even a small one. There's a Pizza Hut and a Hungry Howie's (Michigan chain) near me that both do online ordering, and they're about the same price but only Pizza Hut does gift cards, so I'm not quite sure how to go about it. I've only gotta feed myself, so I don't necessarily need much. I can try to pay you back, if you don't mind it possibly taking a while- I'm moving to look for a job. 

P.S. If either of my roommates see this: Hey guys look, there's a subreddit for this!
