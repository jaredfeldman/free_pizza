Just a normal guy here that is low on cash (no more then $30 to last me the rest of the month) and is craving some pizza.

Since I'm in Sweden it might be a bit tricky but I do have a paypal account. I've been thinking about buying someone a pizza here for a while and I'll be sure to return the favor as soon as I get my paycheck :).

Cheers guys.
