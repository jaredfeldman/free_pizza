This is a throwaway account because I know people from real life on reddit. I have been having a LOT of financial trouble and I barely have enough to feed the kids, the wife and me. I have no problem letting the kids and wife eat over me but the thing is we barely have enough money to feed the kids an pay the bills. After I get done paying the bills I only have about 20 bucks to feed my family. I go to the dollar store and buy them some food but they are getting tired of eating the food from there. I would be so happy if someone were to give us a pizza and would gladly repay you when I get back on my feet. I'm at work right now but I'm doing this now because I don't want the kids to tell me how they want to eat something else. I live in Austin,Texas and if you read this thank you for taking the time to read my plea.
