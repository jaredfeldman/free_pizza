Please don't judge that my account is new, I know it is frowned upon. But I was referred to here by an old friend who had received help here before. 

Me and the room mate have been struggling on cut hours to make ends meet, but this week has been hell. My kitchen has become full of gnats, and despite all my cleaning and scrubbing of every corner they refuse to leave. Now, i know it can take a while for them to go away, but what's frustrating about it is that I put my last bit of spending money into trying to get rid of these things. My girlfriend won't let me cook for her in fear of these things getting in the food.

Now, we get paid again in just a couple of days. And a pizza is all we need to get us there. I hate begging, I do. But once we get paid and I am able to spend again I promise to either pay back the person that helped me, or pay it forward. Anyone please?
