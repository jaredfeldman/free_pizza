Hi,
I had surgery three months ago to reconstruct my acl and meniscus. Because of the physical nature of my job I have been unable to work for the past three months although I have started back up this week past week so hooray for that. We do have insurance to pay much of the bills for which I am thankful, but the bills we have had to pay have wiped us out and put us in debt. No money in the bank account until Friday when my husband gets paid and in the meantime no food in the pantry but rice and beans which we've been eating every single night this week.
I've never asked for assistance before and feel slightly unworthy when there are people with no food in their pantry out there. Still, if anyone can spare us a pizza tonight we'd be very grateful. We're vegetarians so please no meat. I will be happy to pay the pizza forward next month when I get my first paycheck.
Thank you.
