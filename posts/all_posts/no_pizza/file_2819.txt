This is a throwaway account, but I'll provide my regular account to anyone who asks for it over PM. It's just that I have a friend who's a redditor and I'd rather she not know of my predicament :)

Basically I've been eating ramen and macaroni and cheese for the past week because I have 3 cents in the bank. The reason for *that* is that I forgot that my student loan payment hadn't already been taken out of my account and spent the money on some pillowcases, pillows, and sheets instead of on groceries like I should have.

Anyway, I'm not going to starve by any means, but I've run out of macaroni and cheese (and milk) so all I have til Thursday when I get paid is ramen. Location is eastern NY state.
