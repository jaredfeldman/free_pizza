I live in MA, I'm gluten free, and everything in my apartment that I could eat kind of sucks. I would really, really appreciate some gluten free pizza from domino's for my boyfriend and me :]. Ask me for details and whatnot, I have some other allergies as well.

Hoping to be able to regift some one of these days!
