So, in light of the article that has been floating around here, I feel kind of timid about putting this out there, but I guess I have nothing to lose at this point. In the past, he has searched my reddit history and scolded me for things I posted, etc., but I know that a throwaway won't be acknowledged, so I guess I'll take my chances on him getting mad about this.

I've been in an emotionally abusive relationship for quite some time, and it has been absolutely wrecking my sense of self/sanity.   This weekend, we were supposed to go to his family's cabin, and over the course of the week there were many , "well, I'm going alone!" and "I want you to come with, baby" moments.  That is probably the tamest and most concise way to tell the story.  Last night, he was shining a flashlight repeatedly, directly in my eyes, to try and make me go to bed with him, if that gives any insight.

I am proud of myself for deciding not to go with him this weekend, even if we were on a "high" this afternoon. 

I am moving out the first of August, and am trying desperately to save money for my security deposit/first month's rent. To be honest, I was looking forward to free meals with his family, but I decided it wasn't worth it.

The icing on the cake is that I'm one of those people who doesn't eat when they're stressed out, so right now it's just me, a box of wine, and whatever I ate yesterday hanging out in the house.  Logic tells me I should eat.   Anyone?

I would absolutely love to pay it forward when I have my feet on the ground.
