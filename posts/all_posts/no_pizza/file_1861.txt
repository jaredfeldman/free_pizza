it's new year's day here in mendoza, argentina, and everything is closed.  no delivery.  no supermarkets.  no (few?) gas stations.

i've just moved into a temporary apartment while the mother and brother of a friend with a new baby stay in my apartment.  and i don't have much for supplies in the house-- i haven't had time to stock up on much other than gatorade and water.  not even a bottle of wine.  i think there are a couple of bananas and an egg...

is anyone up to the challenge of getting me a pizza today?  i'm in central mendoza (chile and colon)

i'll pay it forward. if you hook me up, i'll hook up someone up back at home.
