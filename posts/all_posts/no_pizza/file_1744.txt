Hanging out, alone in my apartment with my cats, and if I eat ramen noodles one more time I might throw up. Would appreciate something real to eat. My account has been in the red for pretty much the last month. Just got my electricity turned back on since I have a deadbeat roommate...
I'll pay it forward as soon as I can.
