We are students struggling to pay rent, and feeling bad eating my girlfriends parents food. It would be awesome to feel like we can relax and just eat some pizza.

If you would like me or my girlfriend to draw you a picture we would be glad to. (She is the better drawer.) if you'd like to see some of her work you can check out her online portfolio [here.](http://www.brookeleighdesign.com/)
