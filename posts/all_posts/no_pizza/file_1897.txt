I was looking up for possibility of free pizza and ran across the reddit free pizza at first was hesitant but I thought I give it a try. My girlfriend and I are in a tough spot, my job has yet to pay me my "lost" hours and we are behind with some bills. We have enough money to pay for rent tomorrow but it may be a week or so before we will get above. Does anyone have it in their heart to provide a pizza for us? In return we will pay it forward to your choosing (I have just thought of a unique idea paying it forward) If interested I will share it with you. Thanks for taking the time to read this.
