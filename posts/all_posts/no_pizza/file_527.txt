Life is a hectic mess right now and eating on the cheap has had its merits, but if I eat one more egg or package of ramen I may cry. I've spent my last bit of money on moving to a new town to start fresh on life, and while things are good, I am craving a pizza like whoa.

Also, it'd be a bit of a celebration to having a job interview today. The pay increase would help oh so very much, so I'm crossing my fingers! Hopefully if the job comes through, I can pay it forward.

Thanks! &lt;3
