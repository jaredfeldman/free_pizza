I just found this site through CNN.  I am deeply touched reading all of these posts.  Both from those in need, and those looking to help.  It is amazing to see people helping each other this way.  There was a point when getting a pizza meant nothing.  It was more of an escape from cooking for the night then a special treat.  Those days are long gone.  In the last year I've gone through a divorce and lost my job.  I do get unemployment, but I'm $500 in the negative every month with just the standard bills, not counting gas or food.  It's a round robin of who gets payed each month based on the impending shut-off notice.  TV service is long gone, and we wouldn't have the internet if not for it being a major part of the job hunt.  We've learned to live on what we have, and I'm grateful to say my kids are too young to fully appreciate where are at four and five.  I make sure they're fed, but I can never give them anything above and beyond that.  It would just be really amazing to be able to surprise them with a pizza some night.  Believe me, I know how fortunate I am to have a roof over our heads, and a car that works right most of the time.  And there are people I'm sure who need so much more than we do.  And as soon as I'm in a position to help them, I guarantee I'm going to be on here doing that.  God bless all of you.
