I was an asshole. I accidentally made my best friend wait for me for 2 hours outside my house... while i was inside the whole time. Asleep. I BLAME THE TWO ALARM CLOCKS THAT DIDNT GO OFF. It was the first time we were going to see each other in like 6 months, and I was a butthole. She's awesome and decided to come back, so I want to be nice and get her her favorite food- Pizza Hut cheese pizza! But I'm broke. So pleease help me look like less of an asshole? :D
