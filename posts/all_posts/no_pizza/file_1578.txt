Okay , title was a bit dramatic.  But he is really sick.  He's been sniffling ,  dizzy , nauseous  and pathetic for the last couple days (his only days off this week)

His family is in a tough financial situation  (Living on savings for the next 12 months until his mom's out of school and into a new job) so he's been eating jello  , and the chicken noodle soup I dropped off for him.

Can we please get him something solid , delicious and pizza shaped to eat so he can get better and return to work tomorrow!? :(
