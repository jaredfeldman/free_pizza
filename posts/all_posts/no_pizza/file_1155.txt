Edit: never mind - managed to find some spare change and buy a packet of dried spaghetti from the local corner shop.

Don't really have much to say apart from the above. It's 8:15pm in London and I literally haven't eaten anything all day. I have a jar of mustard in the fridge and that's it.

My flatmates are on holiday, and my friends and family are all far away. If anyone can gift me a pizza it'll make a huge difference. I'll have a couple of slices now and the rest should tide me over for tomorrow. I have some money from contract work hopefully (*fingers crossed*) coming in next week.

Thanks for reading, even if you don't send me a pizza. It feels good to share.

Edit: My brother gave me a Steam code for Bastion a couple of months ago. I haven't used it yet and I'll happily trade it for a pizza.
