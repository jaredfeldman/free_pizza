Sitting on negative 240$ in my bank account.  Have worked sparingly the last 6 months, just enough to pay rent/utilities.  I haven't had my phone for 2 months because I can't afford that, first time I've ever had my phone shutoff since I've had it, 10 years. 

Of course I will buy someone else a pizza in the near future as well!  Anything helps!  Thanks guys.
