My hours at work got cut which has put me into a financial bind. I'm looking for other work, but right now I don't have a lot of money. On top of that, I recently found out my grandpa's health is deteriorating, which just adds to the stress of everything. I'm just one 22 year old guy, but I'm really tired and stressed out, and could use some delicious pizza to temporarily ease my woes. I have some strong job prospects coming up, and as soon as my money isn't so tight, I will absolutely pay it forward.
