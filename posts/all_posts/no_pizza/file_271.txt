Long story short my work hasn't paid me for a fortnights worth of 12hour shifts (12 days on 2 off... It's been painful), I'm a little over $800 in the red freaking out about my car repayments, rent and everything else in between... I could really use a pizza to check off where the hell food for the day will come from, and come pay day (if it ever comes) will most definitely send on the pizza.

More than happy to verify anything, happy if nothing happens as at least I've finally used my reddit account.
