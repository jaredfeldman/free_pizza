The boyf &amp; I have about $15 until Thursday, which has to be put towards gas for getting to work. I am having a crap time lately and especially today I could really use some kindness and food. My dream would be pizza from my favorite local place, two because the boyf is not a veggie person, but let's be honest...I'd take anything.
