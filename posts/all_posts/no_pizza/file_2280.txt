My fiance and I just moved to AK to spend time with his grandfather who is doing poorly and return to where he grew up. In doing so we have a grand total of 1.55 cents in change and would love to have something substantial to eat other then the few packs of ramen we have to live off of for a month which is worse then the food rationing we have to do with the pets the poor things. We would love a pizza miracle in our home! Next month when we have money we will pay it forward to another desperate soul &lt;3
