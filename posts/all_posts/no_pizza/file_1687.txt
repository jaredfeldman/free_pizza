Just yesterday my bank found fraud activity on my debit card, and shut it down. I won't get another for 5-7 business days, and since I have no cash on hand, no food in the fridge and no nearby bank office, I'm going a bit hungry.

If someone helps me out now, I hope to return the favor once I get my new card by providing a RAOP myself. 

Thanks in advance.
