On my own in student house over the summer - pretty bored and lonely, ran out of money last week and not due any until loan payment in September. Been eating basics from my cupboard for the past few days - I probably won't starve, but a pizza would make such a big difference right now. Won't be able to pay it forward until mid September when I get lots of money, but when I do I will buy a couple if someone helps me out.
Thanks for your time reddit.
