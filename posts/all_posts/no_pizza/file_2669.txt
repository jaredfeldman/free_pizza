Sorry I have to be a panzy and hide behind a throwaway. This is just really embarrassing, we've received pizza from random acts of pizza before and the idea of having to turn to it again as a last resort really bothers me.. 

My husband is doing odd jobs as of right now until he can find a steady job, and I am about to attend college at the beginning of the year. Things have been pretty decent, but we were barely able to pay our rent this month and were only able to buy groceries for which not even lasted up until now as well as a trip to a food pantry. Our pantries and refrigerator is empty and we will not be able to get to the food pantry until tomorrow. It would mean a lot if someone could help us out and get us through the day. 

I understand this is a throwaway, so if someone does decide they would like to help, I'd be more then glad to give my account name, take pictures, give you my facebook page, whatever it is you need.
