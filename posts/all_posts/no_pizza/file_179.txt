My girlfriend and I are college students, we manage to pay our few bills by donating plasma at a local Biolife, unfortunately after our internet and cellular bills we are left with a very small amount of money to live off of and most of that money gets put toward gas to get us back and forth to our school, as well as toward dog food. 

At this point my bank account is overdrawn, I have my computer on craigslist to get a few extra bucks from (im an IT major), and we are struggling to get by.  

I know this is a long shot but all I ask for is a pizza so that we can eat something other than noodles for the first time in almost a week. IF any one would be willing to help out I would be so grateful.  The only problem is that it would have to be an in-store pickup, not delivery, because we live outside of the range of any of the major delivery shops.
