Today, I'm with my 10 year old sister. I spent the day with her yesterday, and I'm going to spend today with her again. I plan on going to the beach with her later. Now, I *do* have money, but sadly, all I have is a $20 from my mom which I think I might need to spend on gas because the tank is almost empty, and my own money, which came from my last paycheck a few weeks ago, and I have been saving. A little help would be appreciated. Now, I would like to give something in return to the sender of the pizza, because I like giving back. So in return, I will draw you whatever you want (mind you, I'm not that talented). Thanks so much!
