Drexel University is almost done with finals week
and I think a great reward for all the students pulling 
all nights and what not would be free pizza

so if theres anyone in west philly that is willing to donate pizza to hardworking students for a midnite pizza party it would be much appreciated

I would be more than happy to help with delivery/getting into the library, or the new learning terrace
