Never got to as a kid. Immigrant parents so we always stayed to basic veg. (my parents were muslims so I wasn't allowed any pork either). 

I discovered bacon in all it's glory. Now I love bacon, pepperoni and ham. It always smelled bad to me as a kid but now smells glorious... 

Kinda lost track. Anyway yeah, always wanted to try the cheese stuffed pizza.
