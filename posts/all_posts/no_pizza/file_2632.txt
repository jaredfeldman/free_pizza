I don't know if anybody can help, with almost everyone on here being US based, but if you can, I would really appreciate it.

I'm starting to think if quitting and getting unemployment wouldn't be better (We have a good system in Ireland, terribly abused though).

I'm not fussy, anything at all really.

Edit: It's rolling towards 10pm here, so I'll just mention that when this post is more than 2-3 hours old it'll be ok until another time. No late delivery in my city, as far as I know. Cheers.
