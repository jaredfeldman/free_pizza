I applied to work at a photography studio to gain experience outside my chosen field and have a chance to fulfill a dream of mine while making money for school. Didn't have any hope because of no past related history, but received a call 1 hour ago to be told I am a candidate for the second and final interview! 

Obviously, as a pay-it-forward, I will fulfill a request as soon as I can afford it.

Thanks guys!
