Listening to 45:33, hence the title. Anyone feeling particularly generous?
I can draw you a picture, or tell you a story, or anything really. I've won a few contests, but never received a pizza. My roommate and I would be super grateful, as we'll be up all night working on our script for a Blaxploitation Zombie Comedy film (sure zombies are played out, but who cares). 

Much love to you all and the community.
