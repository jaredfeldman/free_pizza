No g/f (surprise?), no kids, no otherwise horrible story, just a fluke from my superiors.

My payroll dept slipped and my direct deposit didn't go through. I've already spent all my money and was desperately depending on this check. I'm a little f'd here for another few days.

I'll gladly commit a RAoP in the next few days when the suits upstairs fix this error.
