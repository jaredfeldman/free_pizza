Im a 15 y/o babysitting my sisters kids and I can make them some noodles but I was clumsy and dropped the sauce on the floor so they would have to eat them plain which sucks. The only place to get pizza nearby is Dominos but its not within walking distance so I cant get them anything since I dont have enough cash to pay for delivery and a tip. If anyone could help us out we'd consider ourselves blessed. Thanks.
