Worst week of our lives. My husband and I have been struggling to make bills and feed ourselves for the few past months. This week in particular has gone extremely down hill. We've been sick, without air conditioning in 90 degree weather, power would have been shut off if it weren't for my mother and every little thing in between. Today is our two year anniversary, and we are out of food and money until tomorrow. It would be nice to have some pizza for dinner if someone could help out.

Also, we have no internet, so I'm using my phone. Sorry if I'm slow to respond. :/ 

Thank you in advance if anyone responds. We aren't the type of people who like asking for help, it just seemed like a special occasion.
