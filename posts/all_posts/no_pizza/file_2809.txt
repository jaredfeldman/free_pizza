My partner and I just moved to this town recently after living out of our car for a while and are really struggling to get by. We put everything we had into getting an apartment so we wouldn't be homeless anymore. I haven't been able to find a job since moving, and my partner just finally found a job this week and won't get his paycheck for another two weeks. Rent is due tomorrow so we have nothing left for food. We have applied for assistance from other programs but haven't received anything as of yet. (Also normally my boyfriend recieves the GI Bill, but we had to move so he couldn't be in school this semester.) 

Anyways we have never asked for help before and honestly it's hard even writing this, but we are sitting here trying to scrounge together a meal and it's just not enough. We would love a helping hand until we can get back on our feet - then we'd be happy to pay it forward! Also I'm new to this sub and read the side bar, but if I'm not doing anything correctly just let me know :)
