Well, i assume you want to hear why i went negative.... I put gas in my car this morning (I had 10 or so dollars) but in reality, when i used my card at a gas station 2 days before, it was run through as credit and didnt come out until this afternoon, leaving me with negative funds.  I do not get paid until tomorrow and probably wont eat until around 1-2 PM when my check goes through (direct deposit) Any help is appreciated, and i'll be sure to repay the favor.  God bless.
