Long time lurker here...
As the title says, I've been living off of the dollar menu for the past two weeks on change I've saved up. I ran out of change yesterday, and I don't get paid until Tuesday. The only thing I want is at least one decent meal until then.

Anyone who helps me out will get a pizza when I get my check and one internet hug :D
