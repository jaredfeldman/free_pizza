I have no pity story. I'm not poor (well...I make enough to survive), and I'm not starving. I'd just really like to celebrate. I think I did pretty damn well in the interview, nerves aside. If I get the job, I'll be able to actually make some pizza dreams come true.  

I solemnly vow to randomly pay the random act of pizza forward. I'll probably buy somebody a pizza in the future anyway...but I'll make it my duty if a kind stranger were to hook me up. Hell, might even throw in some wings or breadsticks.
