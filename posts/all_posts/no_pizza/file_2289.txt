After having just finished paying two months rent, and my sister's infant getting sick, our family is in a seriously tight bind, cash wise, for the next two weeks. We've had troubles before though and made it through, this just makes it the perfect time to ask for your help in solving the real problem...

After almost a year of trying to convince her otherwise, my mother believes that Reddit is at it's core, a place where people go to lie about how wonderful their life is or post pictures of their animals. (Basically anything told to her about Reddit from watching the news) She doesn't realize that Reddit can be a great source of kindness that can touch even the average user if you seek it from subs such as [/r/depression](/r/depression) , [/r/progresspics](/r/progresspics) and of course [/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza](/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza).

With our recent cash problems, it would go a very long way in making her realize how important Reddit has been to me, along with hopefully making her realize the true nature of the people on this site, if she were to receive a Pizza from a generous stranger during a difficult time.

Thank you in advance! This site and this subreddit are wonderful!
