Well I'm watching my niece, my nephew, and two of his little friends tonight since their mom, my sister, is at work and won't be back until this evening.  They don't really like the food I have (Zucchini pancakes!!), and I don't have the expertise to make them something they'd enjoy.  So I come to reddit in hopes that someone can help the little ones have a dinner they'll like and hopefully hang out with their uncle even if they don't have too :)!
