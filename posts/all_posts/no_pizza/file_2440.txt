Hello fellow Redittors,

I'm a long time reddit lurker (started last summer with the keanu meme) with one favor to ask one kind redittor.

Last night I found out that the pasta box in the counter was empty so I ate my last sandwich and I don't have anything for tonight's dinner.

I would be extremely grateful if one of you generous redittors offered to help me with dinner tonight.

Any type of help is appreciated.
