I work 6 sometimes 7 days a week as a waitress to pay my bills, and live on my own. Was going to go shopping for food today (Which is why I even had all my money/tips on me to begin with....) when some older scruffy guy shoved me to the ground, and stole my purse :( I can get some tips working the day after 2morrow (imagine that, tomorrow is my first day off in 10days *sigh*), and buy food, but I'm really kinda hungry tonight.
