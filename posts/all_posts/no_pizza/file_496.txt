Hey, guys. I know it's going to sound like kind of a sob story, but it's more stressful than sad for me right now. My grandmother died a few months ago, and since then, my grandfather's health has deteriorated rapidly. After weeks of me and my mom alternating between staying with him both at his home and in the hospital and going to my half-time job (an hour away from his house/the hospital he's staying at most of the time), I've had very little opportunity to be able to be home, and tonight is one of the nights I have off. My bank account is in the negative, and nothing aside from some cheese slices and my mother's frozen TV dinners are in the refrigerator.

I'd be more than willing to do some digital artwork with my tablet, or a physical and mail it/scan it in to you for basically anything.

I attempted using the verification system in the sidebar, but I'm not sure if it worked. I think it did, but I dunno.

Thank you in advance - you guys are the best!

EDIT: sorry, forgot to put where I am. Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.
