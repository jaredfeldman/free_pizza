The Infinite Well of Ramen Noodles has run dry. The villagers were greedy, dipping too often into it with the ladle and tongs. Now the children shall starve... unless we can feed them another way?

For a nominal fee of providing edible sustenance that doesn't slurp when I eat it, I shall impart stories of epic proportions based on the whims of the provider. In other words I'll draft a short story based on whatever meaningful or outright ridiculous crap you come up with. Am I any good at writing? Well, I won a Presidential writing award in third grade for an essay I did. I also helped ghost write 2 published works, one of which is in it's fourth printing. The other one was just a paycheck, that lady never stood a chance from the beginning.

The genre is up to you, I can write anything fiction without much trouble. If you want Optimus Prime to viciously beat Rainbow Brite with a broken Buzz Lightyear doll, I'll assemble the necessary back story =). All created works are royalty free, so turn em in to short story contests, publish them in a magazine, whatever.

I am hoping for at least $25 dollars worth of food, I can toss together a good read for that much, and I can eat a couple days off that. But longevity wise I need food for the rest of the week, so the more you donate the longer it'll be. Offer is open to anyone and I will accept up to 3 requests for stories, just make sure if you want something "romantic" that it's tasteful or I'll be inclined to turn it down.

That is all, hope I can snag a few jobs and keep the fridge full for a few days, thanks in advance guys =)
