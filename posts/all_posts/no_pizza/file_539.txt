Well, it's Thursday and I am hungry. We get paid on the 15th of every month at my job, and when I looked when I paid all my bills for the first half of the month, I thought the 15th was a Sunday which means we would have got our paychecks tomorrow (Friday since they do not direct deposit on the weekend).

The first half of the month always kills me in bills so I know to be tight with money until I get paid next...well, I didn't expect to not have any money all weekend. Whoops. It is totally my fault though, since I totally looked at the wrong date. Derp.

Anyways, just looking for some dinner tonight that will last over into breakfast/lunch tomorrow, but I am not poor or needy by any stretch of the imagination, **SO THAT MEANS THAT IF THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE POSTING THAT SOUNDS AS IF THEY NEED THIS PIZZA WAY MORE THAN ME, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF CHEESE GIVE IT TO THEM OVER ME!**

I just want to get a pizza today and pay for it once I get paid, so that means if you buy me a pizza, come Monday you can (read: **YOU GOTTA DO IT MAN**) PM me saying *Hey, I bought you that pizza on Thursday, I want my pizza back now bitch."* and you'll have a pizza sent right to your door!

Or, if you're feeling x2 times as generous, email me a link from RAoP that you chose and feel is needing a pizza, and I'll randomly send them a pizza. Pretty much, I feel shitty asking for a pizza tonight because it is just piss poor planning on my part with my pay, so I'd love to just give the pizza back to you next week or give it to someone else you deem is worthy.
