I don't even think it could work, but I would be really thankful because I'm starving, penniless and sick of eating whole grain bread.
As far as I know, the only way to get pizza here is over the phone. We have pizza hut, Domino's, Papa John's and some other local things. 1 dollar is about 500 Chilean Pesos.
If we don't make it, at least we could have fun trying to figure out a way!

ps. yep, i've posted it before, but I'm still poor and hungry!
