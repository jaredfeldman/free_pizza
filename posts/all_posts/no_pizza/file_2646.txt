Our rent spiked up by $120 (now being charged for Water and Garbage, monthly pet rent, and increased rent rate) coincidentally on the same month she is graduating college, so things have been a bit crappy the past two weeks. All of our money has gone to the new place, and I know some Dominos would bring her some much needed relief, if even for a night. I appreciate even checking out my post, thanks everybody!
