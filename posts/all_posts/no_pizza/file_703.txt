College diets are a bitch, especially if you're in that awkward summer waiting time.  I'm trying to hold out until the fall quarter starts up, but it's not easy.  The twist is, I'm not actually a redditor, I don't know the community or anything.  My boyfriend is a redditor and linked the RAOP page and suggested I try it, but I myself am not a member of the community, so I completely understand if it's like a real redditors only type of thing.  But, figured I might as well try it anyway, nothing to lose right?
