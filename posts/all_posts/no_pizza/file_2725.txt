Today i just finished telling my Mum, dad and my Grandad that i am Transgender, and i will be starting to transition from Male to Female. 

My mother was not okay with it. According to her now, i am disowned from the family, and can no longer speak to her, unless i say i am deciding to not transition.

My dad's reaction was so misinformed that i inadvertently lost my cool trying to explain it, where i was then met with a stern 'Get out until you figure out that you're not a tra*ny'. 

My Mormon Grandad however, was not hostile, was not disagreeing, but merely said, "Whilst i do not understand it, i'm sure you can help me find out." He accepts what i'm doing and will not hold it against me, and will not treat me differently until i ask. 

I think i figured out where i'm staying for the next few years whilst i finally start on my path to feeling better in myself.

does anyone wanna help round off one of my most difficult days ever, and buy me a pizza? It would seriously help me to calm down and take my mind off the massive dilemmas that have happened.

If you wish to see proof of anything, or just ask me any questions, please do below :)

I'm sorry if i've said anything offensive during this as well, no offense was intended!
