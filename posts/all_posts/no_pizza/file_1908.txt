Some friends and I are coming to Memphis, TN in just a few hours.  We're driving up from Little Rock.  Unfortunately, the best man recently got laid off and most of the rest of us are underemployed. Memphis is about the furthest away that we could afford to go.  Don't get me wrong, we are going to give him a fantastic send-off from the single life.  Even if it means being late on bills next month.  But a little pizza kindness would be so amazing and would take some stress off.  The groom is a great guy and he deserves an amazing bachelor party.  We're cramming 9 guys in one room at the Marriott.  Message me if you just have a craving to help make a party a little more awesome.  Thanks for reading.
