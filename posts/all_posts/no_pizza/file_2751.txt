Im asking for a pizza, not because you should feel sorry for me, but because fun to interact with strangers. Have you ever thought its strange that people think it is ok to ask for money from total strangers but they think it is too much to ask to get into a personal conversation with people who help them? I think most the people here are have good intentions for giving away pizza and dont need to be treated like a stalker or rapist or whatever. Im not going to open up my whole life to you, but I promise more than trivial conversation and interaction.

And I really need this pizza, Im saving for college, Ive been eating really cheap food lately.

I live in Gig Harbor, Washington

The reason I dont have many posts on reddit is that I am not able to access my old account under the name "arquebus", it says that no email exists for that name, so I dont know how to get it back. I used to post a lot at www.reddit.com/r/programming/ under that name
