Austin, TX   We get paid Friday and I think my kids will attack me if we eat peanut butter or spaghetti one more time. We aren't usually quite this broke but a poorly planned move and we are on our last dimes for two more days. Please, sir, may I have some moar pizza?

Edit: Aw geez. I forgot to say where I am.
