Fellow ents,

I am currently in a pickle.  I went out last night and forgot to close my tab before I left the bar.  Currently, however, I am too high to go and get it from the bar.  Simultaneous, my state has made me very hungry and would love to order people.  Alas, I can't because I don't have my card.  If any of you can find it in your heart to help me out, I promise to pay it forward when the time comes.
