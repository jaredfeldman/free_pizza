Just got hip replacement revision surgery, got home from the hospital today.  Boyfriend is at work and I can't stand up long enough yet to make anything half-decent.  I'd pay for it myself, but my last paycheck went towards hospital fees (those leeches really drain you) Unfortunately I can't take these delicious pork chops I'm cooking in Minecraft out of the screen, so I'd appreciate if anyone would help me out with dinner tonight.  A medium will last me like at least 3 days.  I have a picture of the gnarly incision they gave me if you want the proof, since I am new to Reddit.  And I did the verification thing.
