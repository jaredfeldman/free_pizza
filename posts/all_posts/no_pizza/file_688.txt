Basically I had unexpected expenses this month out of money and desperate for a pizza. 

I Have a Tera account with level 48 Beserker and the account has founder status.Its not much but only thing i have right now that i can live without. Eating is much higher on my priority list right now than playing Tera.
 
If you don't want the account I will be happy to pay it forward to someone this friday when I get my paycheck.
