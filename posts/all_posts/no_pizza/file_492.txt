I was up until 7am coding a website, had to wake up at 8:30am, resumed coding until 12pm, a friend smoked me down, came down around 3pm, but I couldn't go to class because I was way too tired. I'm now starving and can't go home for another hour and a half. :( Then it's another hour before I get home.

Anyway, I'll do something for a pizza, if you tell me what you want. :)

That something could include an Amazon purchase for you of up to $10.28. I have $10.28 stuck in an MTurk account, which I can transfer to a gift card balance and purchase something if you'd like. I don't have a bank account to withdraw it myself. I believe I can turn it into an [online gift card to Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order/ref=gc_dp_conv_order?ie=UTF8&amp;casin=B004LLIKVU&amp;type=Email&amp;design=a_generic_white_10_us), if you want $10.28 in Amazon credit for some pizza. :)

**EDIT**: Turns out I can not turn it into an Amazon gift card. If you'd like me to purchase something for you though, I will. I can't purchase digital downloads, gift cards, subscribe &amp; save, or Amazon Prime according to the Amazon help.
