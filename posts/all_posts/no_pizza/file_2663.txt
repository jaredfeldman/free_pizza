I really love the idea of this "Random Acts of Pizza"  I'm kinda short on cash or else I'd be glad to send out of some pizza love.  I accidentally screwed up my wife's laptop the other day and I'm hoping to surprise her with some kick ass pizza.  Screwed it up soo bad she's making me buy her a brand new one...  and it was an apple macbook...  bla... Anyone from the Kansas City area want to pay it forward?
