Before making this post, I did read through several threads and the sidebar on the right. I heard about this site a few months back on ABC, but I did not think to sign up. 

I don't have a sob story or any real need for a pizza other than it will brighten my day. Since I've been on the site for a few days, my request will more than likely be overlooked. I'm not complaining :D ! I realize this is all random and that there are others out there who may have a genuine story and need pizza tonight. To everyone that has donated, keep doing what you're doing :)
