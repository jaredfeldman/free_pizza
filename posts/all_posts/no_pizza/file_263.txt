Been working all week last week and I don't get paid for it soon enough. during that week I stayed at a friend's empty eating nothing but rice with soy sauce since I was only paid 20 dollars for the week. The week before that wasn't swell either.

If anyone would help it'd be greatly appreciated, as I haven't had much of anything this week and I'm dying to get paid..
