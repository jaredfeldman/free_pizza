I have a boatload of tests this week and am hoping to use this weekend to finish my final projects and study a bit. I've hit a bit of a financial hiccup (http://imgur.com/Lw5wjsH), and am down to my last few dollars and a small bag of rice until sometime next week. 

Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated! Pizza lasts a few meals for me, and there is a cheap 5 dollar pizza place fairly close if any kind soul might be able to give me a hand. :)
