I had to take the week off in order to move in, so I didn't bring home any tips which would normally get me through. If I could get a pizza to hold me over the next evening and lunch/dinner tomorrow, I could make it last until Saturday and have enough money to pay it forward on demand.

If anyone could help me out, I would be so incredibly grateful and if there is any way I could help you out even besides a random act of pizza, I'll do what I can to the best of my ability (provided it is completely reasonable; I'm sure I can take out an entire high rise of elite bodyguards guarding your kidnapped grandmother, but I don't really have the time for it in my schedule).
