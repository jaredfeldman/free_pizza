My money should have come in at the beginning of May but it hasn't and cheap as they are, I really can't afford takeaways. I live in England and there are quite a few near me still open (according to Just Eat). If anyone knocking about would be able to help it would be much appreciated, this was done on a whim so no worries if no one can.
