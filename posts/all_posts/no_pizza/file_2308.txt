My girlfriends car broke down on the side of the road last night, and she spent the last of our money getting it towed 60 miles back home (Bellingham, WA.). This expense means she will now be unable to pay utilities or the car payment this month. The only reason she was down there was because we were not getting along, which was mostly my fault. I have no money but would like to give her a pick me up. Some za would probably do the trick. Any help would be appreciated.
