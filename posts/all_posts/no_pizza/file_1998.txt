First time playing Tijuana, Mexico earlier this week and I was a little sketched out. I didnt have a passport just my drivers license but I was told that would work. I made every precaution to play it safe, not taking it out and aware of my surroundings. When I placed my wallet in my jacket and set it next to my amp before I went on, someone grabbed it and it was nowhere to be found. Had to pass through secondary which was a 2 1/2 wait and ended up calling my mom to bring my birth certificate over. I lost my credit card, my newly acquired license, debit card, spare car key, a couple gift cards, and my triple a car. Waiting for friday to get paid, Im living off pb and j sandwiches and right now pizza sounds great.
