This is actually my first time on Random Acts of Pizza.
Me and my girlfriend have been in our first tight spot in a long time, I don't get paid for 3 more days, financial aid from ACC has yet to come in, and we are down to 15 dollars, 1/8th tank of gas.
We have been living off pbnj and ramen.
A friend recommended me to this website when she heard how hungry I was at work &gt;.&lt;
I would be extremely appreciative, and would definitely like to help someone in return as well. We can take pictures of the pizza too
Tashia gets off school in about an hour, maybe she can have pizza instead of ramen
