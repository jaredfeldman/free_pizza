Hello, /r/, I am a 19 year old male in sunny Miami who is in a situation that's anything but sunny. I recently lost my job (August 15th was my last day), and I've been living with my mother since the job hunt is not going well. My mom is a 55 year-old who cleans houses for a living, barely able to scrap together the $915 rent, as well as the $220 light bill, $90 cable and internet bill, and our $110 cell phone bill. 

When I had a job, I'd pay for half of everything. Rent, cable, light, and cell phone. We had plenty to eat, and I'd take her out for dinner, and even pay her day's work so she'd have a day to rest.

Now, she pays for everything, and sometimes she works 2-3 jobs every day. I keep going to job interviews, but to no avail. We have no food. We go shopping once a month, but how much can $80 in food last you?

I'm hungry, /r/, I ate my first bit of food for the first time in 2 days today, and it was horrible. 
I long for some good food, and I long for the kindness of strangers.
