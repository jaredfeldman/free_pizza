Freaking on my way home my tire pressure light came on and pulled into my dealer. Figuring that they just needed to put some air in a tire was expecting to be in and out. Two hours later i have to drop over $200 that wiped out my bank account, and now I'm home with an empty fridge and hungry. Any help would be awesome : )
