I turn 20 tommorrow and I don't think I'll work this week because I have to code documents (think identifying docs using a program). Well we don't have enough documents to do (DAMN YOU DIGITAL MEDIA!) so our boss tells my and my coworkers to go home and come back when we get a call. Last time that happened, they called us a week later, so we didn't work a whole week. 

Anyways, I love Pizza. It's my favorite food. And I live in Houston. 

Thanks! 

Edit: I'll give back when I have the money to spend on pizza.
