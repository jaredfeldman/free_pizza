Recently I have started back at university for year 2 and my funding application hasn't been processed yet. I have been volunteering with my local charity and although the work is good and I'm getting experience and references and all that, I'm not earning any money. My application probably won't be processed for another two weeks and until it is i'll have no money, and most importantly, no pizza.
