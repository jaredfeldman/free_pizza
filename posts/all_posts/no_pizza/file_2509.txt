My amazing son Caleb was born three months ago. He's wonderful but a handful. (As is the significant other and other son.) Things in our house are a little crazy now because I went back to work on Monday. 
Chores and bills are piling up and I'm EXHAUSTED. Cooking is the last thing I want to do after diapers, homework, and housework. Money is a little tight because I won't get my paycheck for two weeks.

If there's anyone out there who can help a slightly overwhelmed and extremely tired mom, it'd be greatly appreciated. The family would probably appreciate it more than I would.

Thank you everyone!
