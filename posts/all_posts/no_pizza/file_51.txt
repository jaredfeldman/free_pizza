As the title says I was hit by a drunk driver. It was 2am last night and was 5 blocks away from my friends house. I was driving him home after his farewell party, he is leaving the city on Monday. 

I was coming down a one way street with the right of way and no stop sign/light. He blew thru a stop sign and t-boned me. Before I even got out of my car to start dealing with everything he fled the scene leaving his friend behind in the passenger seat. This guy was visibly drunk and acted as if nothing happened. He fled 20 min after it happened.

I don't get paid until the end of the month but will pay forward as soon as I get my paycheck.

TL;DR drunk drivers suck
