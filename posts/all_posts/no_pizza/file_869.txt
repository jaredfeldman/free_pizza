Hey, I just got off work (11:37pm EST) and have tons of Lab reports to do and a quiz to study for in the morning. Also the paychecks at my work didn't go through this weekend, due to veteran's day on friday, so I wont get paid until tomorrow. I have no money and no time to prepare the scraps I have. Would greatly appreciate a pizza and can pay it forward once my check goes through tomorrow!
