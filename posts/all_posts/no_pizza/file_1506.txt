My pay cheque is being held until tomorrow because I deposited it in an atm last Friday and didn't realize there would be a hold. Stupid move on my part. Anyway would love to eat tonight and now will have 800 coming into my account tomorrow. I got on direct deposit so there won't be a hold. Will try to put an offer up tomorrow regardless of if anyone chooses this or not because I know how much joy a simple act like this would bring.

Thanks RAoP, keep on doing what you're doing, you're making the world a better place.
