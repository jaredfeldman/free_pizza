I'm out of food stamps till the 6th, and I've been eating fruits and vegetables salvaged from dumpsters behind high end grocery store in Berkley. While pizza probably isn't the healthiest source of it, the lack of protein I'm getting from my current diet is making me rather weak, and to be honest, I'm getting rather burnt out of potatoes, carrots, and apples. A pizza would be absolutely killer right now. Please help a girl out, I promise I'll return the favor to someone else in need once I'm less down on my luck.

Edit: A friend of mine just came over with a few groceries for me, so I no longer need a pizza, but if you're still willing to give me one, I'll happily take it.
