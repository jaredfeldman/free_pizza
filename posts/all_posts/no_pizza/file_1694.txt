* 17 years old with Type 1 Diabetes 
* Mom and her boyfriend are on potato diet 
* Nothing but potatoes for a teenager to eat for dinner
* Doesn't want another ounce of potato
* Car in shop getting fixed
* Can't leave 

That's basically the jist of it. I've recently spoken to my mother about no longer participating in the diet, but she agreed that I must now cook for myself. Only problem is that there is nothing but potatoes, beets and carrots available for consumption for now.
