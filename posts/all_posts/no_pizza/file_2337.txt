Hey RAoP, long time lurker, first time poster here. My bank account has $2.78 in it, and my car is on E. Meaning that I can't drive home this weekend to celebrate the Super Bowl with my family, and I'll be eating canned soup again tonight. I already had that for lunch and I would really love a pizza. My loans come in next Monday (they would have come in sooner but the Fin Aid office screwed something up). I'll gladly return the favor if you help me out tonight! Also, I just aced my Income Tax test that's I've been studying for all week, and last week I made a 98 on my managerial accounting test! :)
