Me and my roommate spent our last bit of food budget on getting our laundry done and now we're hanging out with a friend and getting really hungry.

We should be considered minimum priority though because all of us will get to eat tomorrow and nobody's actually in danger of malnourishment or anything. Plus if we get desperate we can call in the emergency egg noodle rations.
