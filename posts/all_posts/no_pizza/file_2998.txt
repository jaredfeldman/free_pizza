I just got out of the hospital a few days ago and immediately spent all of my money on a variety of new prescriptions that I needed to start. I'm out of food now and don't get paid until tomorrow. I'm type one diabetic so I'm kind of afraid that if I don't eat anything at all today I'm going to be in rough shape tomorrow. That, and after over a week of hospital food and dry cereal pizza sounds amazing. So if someone would be generous enough to provide me with one, I would appreciate it greatly.
