I limit myself to buying grocery store food and packing lunch because I can't afford eating out at work, but today it seems I'm going to be unexpectedly stuck here for another two hours or so and I didn't plan and bring dinner. The tupperware full of pasta I brought for lunch is long gone and my tummy is rumbling. Anyone willing to help me out with something to tide me over?

I'd be happy to share with the other research assistants who are stuck here, too. They look a little worn and would love the surprise, I'm sure.

Thanks for the consideration.
