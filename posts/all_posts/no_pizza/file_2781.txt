Hey, I'm currently kicking an IV oxy and heroin habit and going through withdrawals and have no money so could deal with a free pizza.  I've never actually done this before so it'd be cool if someone could walk me through.  

Location:  Southern Oregon

Note: Papa John's is the only one that will deliver where I live and I'd really prefer a gift card so that I don't need to give out my address.
