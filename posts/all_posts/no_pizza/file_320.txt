I have two friends who are on hard times right now. They just moved and are living paycheck to paycheck. They've had to go without food for a few days now, and I hate to see them like this and not be able to do anything about it myself (Since I'm also scraping by). Any help would be appreciated. I'd love to be able to tell them food is on its way.
