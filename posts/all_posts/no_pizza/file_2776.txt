Hello,

 I am hoping someone will take a small bit of pity on me and help me get my husband and his twin brother a pizza for their birthday today.

I have no extra money, was not able to buy them a cake or even a cake mix to make them one.

I know I am asking a lot but a pizza would be great, and if I get one I will pay it forward on January 25th when I get paid.

Thank you for reading this.

Nikki
