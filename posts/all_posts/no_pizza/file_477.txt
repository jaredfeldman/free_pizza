I've been working at an awesome internship in Hollywood this summer, and I think it would be great if I could get a large cheese pizza for my boss as thanks. The other intern and I already have a card and simple gift for him. Would anyone be kind enough to help out and make our last day (8/12) really awesome?

*Edit:* We'll take pics of us eating the pizza!
