I am one of the few that can say I bought at a house at the age o 20.  With this, I found comes many, many extra bills I never thought of.  Food doesn't always come first, and I'm pretty broke right now, and would appreciate anyone willing to send a pizza my way.  Nothing major is required or asked for.
