Moved to CA, it's hard out here, looking for work, planning on ramen tomorrow for thanksgiving because it's all I have currently.  Roomate drank all my milk so it's Water for me!

I live with a sociopath downstairs that refuses all human contact, an elderly lady that is the owner of the house is going with family.  I came to the west coast to chase my childhood dream of becoming a Game Designer! I posses a B.S. in game development from brown college in MN where I overpaid for it.  I am currently relying on IT contracts that are very slow coming through and honestly I was not prepared for bus transfers costin $6.00 per ride from here to the nearest metropolitan city.  

I know three people out here, the mountains are beautiful, the ocean is breathtaking, and the way people smoke marijuana in the streets free of law enforcement harassment is still a bit of a culture shock for me to see.  

I don't expect a pizza, because every post I make on reddit i get a cynical post right away and a dozen downvotes.  but if somebody reads this and knows what it feels like to be alone on thanksgiving i'll feel accomplished i guess.  

EDIT: to replace text with "the west coast"
