I lost my job about a month ago and have had no luck in finding a new one. I just ended up having to move back home as well because I could no longer afford to pay rent. I'm not starving or going to go hungry, but a pizza would be really great right now, and I would much rather have it than easy mac for the 4th night in a row. I'll happily repay it as well once I finally have a job again!
