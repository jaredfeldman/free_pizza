I cant pay my bills, much less pay for food. Ive been eating Thanksgiving leftovers everyday, which is pretty good eating. At least its not Ramen noodles or toast everyday. But I feel the cheezyness could raise my spirits enough to get thru the rest of the year.

The favor would surely be forwarded when I get back up on my feet.
