Tomorrow I have a pretty stressful day ahead of me. I've got to do tons of calling and mailing and application filling out to do in order to drop one school and enroll in another. I'm pretty terrible at handling stress too so a pizza would be a perfect way to unwind after it all. Any from the big 3 would be fine, but Pizza Hut is my favorite!
