I'll try to keep this short and to the point. I just recently moved, I'm broke, my car is giving me issues, and a mess of other stuff. I'm in a great mood right now though! A pizza would just send me over the top. If you really just want to make a dumb kid (I'm in my 20's) happy, I'm your guy. Thanks a lot. If you want any more info you can message me.
