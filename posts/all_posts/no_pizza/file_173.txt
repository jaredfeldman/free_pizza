Everyone has their sob story, so here's mine. 

My boyfriend recently quit his job. He worked retail, and generally hated everything about it. He's wanted to be a programer for ages now and since he quit he's looking to actually do it. So, he's home all day and I'm the one working to support us. We recently applied to get SNAP assistance but haven't heard back yet.. So the fridge is getting empty to the point of silliness.

That being said, to add a little motivation i guess, If I manage to get a pie I'll build you a shrine  in my SMP Minecraft world. :D Will provide pictures as well to prove it all.

(Papa Johns is the only chain store that is in my area, but there's a ton of little mom and pop stores that offer like $5 pies)
