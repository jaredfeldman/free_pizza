My friends and I are working on our High School Senior gift, an enormous mural. (Even though we have already graduated). I recruited a bunch of non- artistic friends, because my original "art" partner totally bailed on me with the entire thing. We would love a pizza! PM if you are feeling generous! (No Pressure!) We are willing to carry out!
