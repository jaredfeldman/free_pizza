I am babysitting a four and a two year old for one of my best friends. Her and her husband are going to hawaii for a long waited much needed honeymoon five years late. her flight was suppose to be tomorrow but that one got canceled and the best option for them was to take a flight a day early. This has but a big burden on me beings tho tomorrow I get my food stamps which is the only reason I said I could watch her children for her, because I feel pathetic not having any food for them. I feel like a horrible aunt.
