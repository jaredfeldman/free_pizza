This week has been really shitty. My best friend came out a couple days ago and his parents won't talk to him. He spent Valentine's Day with me, which made me depressed. I dont think he wants to go back to his house, which I am fine with for now, but I want to help bring them all back together. Anyways, if someone can help us out with some lunch today, that would be cool,, and it may cheer him up a little.
