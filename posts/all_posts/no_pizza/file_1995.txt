Hey everyone, I'm about 2 months pregnant and im starving tonight. I dont get paid until the 1st in a couple days but I have zero food for tonight, not even some ramen noodles or bread. I'm literally out of everything. I was gonna go to a local church tomorrow to see if they could give me a couple of days worth of food but for tonight I have nothing to eat. If anyone could help me out with 1 hot pizza for tonight I'd be so happy, ty so much!
