After a tiring two-weeks, including an ambulance ride for one kid, a hospitalization (she's okay now), 1 with a head ache (she's only 4, and has cluster head aches), and 1 that's home schooled due to bullies (Autism). This mommy is TIRED and could use a pizza night! We can't afford it right now. I'll make it up to you guys and pay it forward when things are not so crazy around here! 

Also, for verification of the medical stuff I can forward you to our facebook page for our kids medical updates, I just don't want to post it publicly. 

Thanks in advance!
