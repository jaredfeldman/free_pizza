There are 70 brand new teachers coming for training on Monday (06/24). Some of them are buying their own dinner (yay!) but some of them flew or drove all across the country to meet in Middletown to start training. 

I'm a helper-outer-person for the non-profit training all these cool people, and I did the same thing last year (showing up to CT from 350 miles away) with zero dollars in my bank account. I don't want these people to have to worry about dinner on Monday. 

Something like a Big Y pizza would be best because it's the cheapest way to feed a large group. Anything helps, though!
