Hey there guys I was just flicking through random subreddits and I stumbled on this! Well you probably get starving students all the time I guess. I'm a second year at Otago uni but I'm still only 17, meaning I live on the unsupported child benefit instead of the Student Allowance. After rent and power I have 70$ per week to live on (that's NZD too); the thing is I brought two 16$ posters for my room in my new flat (kinda a mistake) and now I'm kinda starving. Been eating nothing but noodles and these cheap (disgusting) beef patties all week. 

So yeah I'd appreciate a pizza SO MUCH! I'd be willing to post a funny pic or whatever if that's what people usually do here? cheers guys!
