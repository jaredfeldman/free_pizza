You know you have the badass-ity somewhere deep inside of you. Maybe it's in your wallet. Check there first. Okay, it's in there? Good, here's the back story.

We have no food left for tonight, we're pretty much stuck until tomorrow without any sort of consumables. Yeah, sounds like a fun night, right? Not really? Well, maybe you can be the individual that solves this issue. That's right! For just ONE EASY PAYMENT, you could rest more easily tonight knowing that you helped out a group of four rather hungry individuals, granting them the sustenance to last until tomorrow.
