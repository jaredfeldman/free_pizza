So, a friend got screwed out of a place tonight (landord dick-ness), and as such is stuck using what little money she has left paying for a hotel in Southwest Florida. If you kind pizza-ers can give her a hand that'd be swell. I know it's not me, but she's never used Reddit, and College has also left me quite poor. You have my word that I will pay it forward. Thanks regardless!
