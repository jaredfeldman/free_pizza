Hi there, I have this friend, he's my best friend and he's going through a really hard time right now. A pizza would cheer him up a lottttttt C: I was wondering if there would be anything I could do to get him a simple small cheese pizza. I would do it myself, but I'm dirt poor. You can request what you want for thanks, I don't have very much to give. But, it would be nice if he had a smile on his face for a little while. (: 

P.S He lives in Thomaston, Connecticut; will anyone help me make him feel better? :3 Please and Thank you &lt;3
