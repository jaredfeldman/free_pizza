Hey guys, I haven't quite gotten on my feet (i.e. found employment) after spending the summer on the road before my band broke up a couple months ago.  I'm sitting in an empty apartment with a laptop and a can of cream of shrimp soup.  (Oh ramen, how I miss you.)  
SOOOOO, if someone would be kind enough to help me out with a delicious pizza, I'd be more than happy to write and record a little ditty thanking them.  Not that that's worth much, but...it'd be fun?
