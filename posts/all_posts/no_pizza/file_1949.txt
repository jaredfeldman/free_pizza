Been roaming around on this subreddit for awhile but didn't have any need to post. I'm not in any dire situation but wanted to see if anyone was feeling generous tonight. I go to Ohio State, living right off of campus, and just haven't had time to get out to the grocery store this week. If anyone out there could help me out just for tonight it would make my night. Thanks for taking the time to read, love what this place is about.
