My family and I would really love to catch a break.  It feels like the last few months have just been nothing but bad news, from my wife losing her job, our family car breaking down and requiring over $3500 to fix it, my job cutting hours and pay, just a whole bunch of negative stuff we're going through.

My two daughters and son are my rock and my world, why I get out of bed in the morning to work a job where I'm underpaid and busting my back day in and day out.  I would love to be able to surprise them with a nice little pizza treat at some point, try to boost their spirits during this rough patch in our lives.

I would love to be on here with a different story, one in which I'm able to give out pizza to those struggling within the community, and hopefully, who knows, I might be able to at some point.  All I know is that I will pay it forward in any way possible when I can.
