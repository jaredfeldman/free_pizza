So, on my way to visit my parents I got a phone call. My mom clearly having difficulty speaking finally she let out, "ginger died."

Ginger was a 1.5 year old golden doodle. The little sister to our older dog dusty. She was a beautiful loyal curly haired monster who did not deserve to die.

I'm now sitting home alone because my fianc√© is at work in the navy, looking at gingers pictures, just sad. 

I don't feel like cooking.

I would greatly appreciate a pizza.

Thank you.
