Hey y'all,

I'm a college kid in Conway, Arkansas who's pretty broke at the moment. I'm cool with ramen, but I'd be even cooler with some pizza, since my school cafeteria, for whatever stupid reason, doesn't serve dinner on Saturdays. Hmph.

Anyway, as stated in the title, I will definitely sing you a song in exchange for such a wonderful act of feeding me! And I promise to share the pizza with my roommate, because I'm a nice lady. ;D
