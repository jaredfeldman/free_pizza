I don't know what to do.

I suppose I should've seen this coming -- she used to disappear for days on end, and I couldn't make contact with her, let find out where she went -- but nothing can really prepare you for it. We even traveled *across the country* together for college, and now she's gone. From Seattle to North Carolina, for god's sake. For all I know she could be in some other guy's pants right now.
I miss her. I miss how she smelled, how I could always turn to her in times of trouble, because, deep down inside, she held the answers.  

I miss my wallet.
