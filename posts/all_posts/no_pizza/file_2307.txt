I barely slept last night so this won't be very eloquent. Yesterday evening my little dog had a seizure. She's had them before (very rare, vet said not to worry bc of infrequency) so we let her ride it out and she seemed to be feeling better. Then at 5am this morning she had another seizure, then another at 8am. I brought her to the vets where she got diagnosed with epilepsy and given some medicine. When we got home she had a 4th seizure and I had to bring her back for IV medication and medical monitoring. I'm a grad student (ergo broke) and am out $450 in vet bills just today and worried sick about my pup. 

Please help me out. There is a Papa John's nearby and also a locally owned small pizza place that does online orders. I can provide proof of my story and I'm sure my pup would love a little pizza crust when we get to bring her home.
