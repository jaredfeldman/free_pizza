This is my throwaway as I have family members who are redditors and dont really want them to know I'm asking for help. If you'd like I can send you a message from my regular account to verify.
Just need some dinner tonight so I can get my son some shoes tomorrow. I know I could go to pay less and get him some cheapo's he doesnt want and wont last but I hate disappointing him.
