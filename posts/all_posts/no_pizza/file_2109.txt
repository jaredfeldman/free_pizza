Hi, first timer here! I'm down to my last $10, waiting for some good news later next week. My job, home and girlfriend all fell away in the past couple of months, and I have little else left. I could really use some help; a pizza would give me 2 days of good eating, maybe even enough for the whole weekend. I'm in Manila, Philippines. Pizza can be ordered online from yellowcabpizza.com.

Sincere thanks!
