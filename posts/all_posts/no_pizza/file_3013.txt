Okay, so me and my roommate are in a sticky situation. We both don't get paid until Thursday, and we haven't eaten all day. We also don't have much food left in the house, just chips and snacky stuff. My mom cant help me with money until tomorrow night and her parents don't even live close to us. A Egift card for pizza would work wonders right now.
