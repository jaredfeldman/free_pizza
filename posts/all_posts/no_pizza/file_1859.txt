My fridge is busted, my house now smells like death and all the food (mostly delicious thanksgiving leftovers which I so looked forward to eating) is ruined. My landlord said he will replace fridge this week, but in the meantime I'm hungry and broke. Will someone help this girl out with some pizza? Thanks in advance from Cali.
