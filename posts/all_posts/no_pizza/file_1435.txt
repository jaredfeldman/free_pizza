I don't want to post from my main, but I've been a redditor for some time now. I live with my boyfriend and roommate, and both are in between jobs right now. I've known my roommate since high school and I know that if I ask them to leave, they will have nowhere else to go. I'd love to have a roommate or boyfriend for that matter that doesn't stress me out and put so much pressure on me when it comes to money. I should actually be saying MY MONEY, but I never get to see any of it. My income goes straight to bills and food. 

I am coming to a point where I no longer see both of the people that I live with as just having a hard time. They've been unemployed since February and June, and I've been paying for everything for months. I really can't take it anymore. I can't even put away enough money to take a trip to get away from everything and everyone. Between work and school, I am really at my limit.

I'm hoping that another redditor who has been here before in this situation will help me with something other than canned vegetables for dinner (pretty please? :D). I would love a pizza and it would pretty much make my entire year, because this would be the only nice thing I've gotten. If someone is able to help, you would be a hero! I should also mention that I'm in NYC (Brooklyn stand up!).
