Hi guys, If you are like me then pizza is more to you then just a good food, it reminds you of a time when life was different, when you would hang out with all your friends when that new n64 game or playstation game came out and stay up all night playing it(conquersmplayer) . Before a time when you had to deal with constant rejection from employers, money problems, rent and bills. If there was ever a time in my life when a pizza would mean alot, that time is now. Also me and my roommate have been eating white rice exclusively for the past two months. Well thats how i see it sorry for long post just wanted to say how i feel, thanks guys!
