Hey guys, I'm just looking for any one to help me make it to next week. I don't get paid until Wednesday, but due to a parking ticket ($50! unbelievable) i've been wiped clean of cash. I haven't eaten since Thursday, and while I have no problem with just sucking it up until Wednesday, I have a test Monday and a random act of pizza would really help to get my brain going. 

Thanks for even looking at this!
