I'm not really in a dire situation or anything at the moment, just mildly depressed at recent life events and waiting around until tonight when my brother (and only roommate) gets home from work and we can go grocery shopping.  Wish my car would get fixed already, so I wouldn't be stranded like this!

Unfortunately, we delayed this food run a little too long, and have run out of basically everything edible besides about a dozen apples and some eggs.  lol.  So yeah, I've been eating nothing but apples since I woke up about four hours ago.  Why are these things so unfulfilling?!

Anyway, I was talking about my situation in an irc channel and someone linked me this.  I've read reddit here and there, but never actually took the initiative to get an account or post anything.  But hey, nothing wrong with giving it a shot I guess.  Not sure what exactly I can give for verification, if you guys would like any.  I assume you would, with me being a newly signed up member.  If you feel like throwing a pick me up my way, just let me know what I can do.

Oh, I should probably note that I live in Vegas.
