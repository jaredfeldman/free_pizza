My dead end job is killing me, I hate it, and I work way too hard at it. I got home tonight and wanted to quit, I get shit from customers on the nightly (I work in a restaurant) and I only make meh money. Don't really have a whole lot else going for me at this point. Could use some pizza... but if not, that's cool too, you guys have a great thing going here.
