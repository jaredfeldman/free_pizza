I have been stuck inside my room all day because I had a huge, blow-out fight with my roommate and I don't want to see him. I have no food here and also no money, and can't leave because I have nowhere to go and there is a thunderstorm outside. I have received a pizza before, a couple months ago, and also given one in /r/Food_Pantry. I have $6.30 in PayPal also if someone would like to trade. Thanks for reading!
