Before I tell my story this is a throw away account, I don't want my friends to find out just how bad my family has it right now..

With that out of the way, I just want the chance for my family to eat something decent for a change.  Right now our house is going up for short sale, and we have to move out.  My parents couldn't afford the mortgage anymore, and Bank of America was completely unwilling to work with us in some kind of payment plan; so we're forced to sell and move.  If that wasn't bad enough, I just graduated college and can't get a job (been trying for months, every day; hours on end). 

My step dad was in the hospital for a routine procedure and ended up contracting Sepsis.  So every six hours he has to attach an IV with ampicillin (some of the strongest anti-biotics you can take) so he's unable to work.  While he was in the hospital for almost three weeks, I was taking care of my siblings, making them dinner (which consists of 4-5 chicken nuggets every day..).

This is becoming quite long and I don't want to write a novel, but I'm really truly desperate right now for something to eat (besides nuggets).  I appreciate your time, reddit.
