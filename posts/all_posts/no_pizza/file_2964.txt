Hello folks, figure I'd give this a shot considering my current circumstances.  Now I know I'm not as bad off as a lot of the folks around here but I figure what little help I could get will be appreciated.

Without going into to much detail of my life I'll keep this short.  Before I head overseas I decided to move my family back to where our family is.  The home buying and moving (on my dime) process has dragged on longer than expected and that has cost us more money than budgeted because of the delay.. I have enough money to put fuel back in the tank and right now we are eating basically what we packed out of our pantry.  We have to last little less than a week and we'll be good.

I have a couple of older boys with me and I'm sure they'd also appreciate some pizza about now...  Thanks in advance and it feels good be get back home to Oregon....
