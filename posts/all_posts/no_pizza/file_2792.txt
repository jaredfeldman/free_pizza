I'm currently staying in a motel for a few nights while awaiting a financial aid check, thanks to an assistance program in my local town. I've been eating protein bars, and hot dogs which is what I've been able to afford cooking in a microwave. Anyways, I have class all weekend, studying really  hard and I could sooooo use a pick me up like a pizza! Being homeless has been tough, but I'm working really hard to build a better life for myself, despite a few hiccups...
