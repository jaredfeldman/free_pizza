I'm having some friends over to my new place for a movie night and I have very little food to feed them with, and even less money to buy food/snacks. I love being a good host but it's been harder lately while I wait for work to pick up. Any help would be great thanks in advance!

I realize this isn't the most dire need of pizza. But it would be a great welcome to this community and I'd love to pay it forward in the future. I also got left in the dark with redditgifts on the last exchange so it'd be nice to have SOMETHING given to me.

EDIT: More begging
