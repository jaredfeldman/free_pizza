For those who don't know, AP classes are high school classes that allow the opportunity for college credit at the end.

Tomorrow I have AP Calculus AB, Friday I have AP US History and AP European History, and next Wednesday I have AP English Language and Composition. 

I've been studying my ass off and craving some good (or crappy, I'm not really that picky) pizza, and it occurred to me that there's a subreddit just for this!
