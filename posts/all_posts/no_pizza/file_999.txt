My GF and I both work at Kroger which pays not well at all. We both have no money that can go towards food and have been eating rice for a week. Our fridge broke this week so all of our refrigerated food had to be thrown away or eaten a couple days ago. Any pizza would be appreciated. Thank you ahead of time if you can offer. Also, We live in Atlanta, Ga.
