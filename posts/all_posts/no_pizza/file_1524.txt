I just moved to a new city in Indiana (Evansville) with my boyfriend. Finally got a job but unfortunately I don't have any extra spending money until after Christmas (I am saving up for a nice present for my boyfriend.) We have milk and some random condiments in our fridge, as well as a lone strawberry poptart in the cupboard. I get payed tomorrow so I can buy a few essentials but tonight we have nothing but a milky poptart. Help?
