I am feeling depressed. I do not know if it is the study of law and the tedious reading that goes with it or the hunger in my belly causing it. If some kind soul wishes to help me eliminate the hunger in my belly, we can narrow the source. I would eternally grateful to any kind soul wishing to assist me in these trying times.
