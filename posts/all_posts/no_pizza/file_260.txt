Hey Reddit.  I've never had to do this before and it's pretty embarrassing.  I literally have just change in my bank account and don't get paid again until Friday.  I figure if I find someone nice enough to send me a pizza, I could have a slice tonight and lunch and meals for a few days.  I'd greatly appreciate it and you have my word, on Friday this week I'll put in a post to pay it back.  I have a real reddit name of over 2 years this is just a throw away because I'm too embarrassed.  Thanks guys!!

Doh! Never done this before.  I'm in MD.  Sorry it's not in the title!
