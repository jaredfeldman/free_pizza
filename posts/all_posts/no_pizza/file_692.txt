My very first post on Reddit was to give a pizza! Now I'm in an apartment with friends with nearly two feet of snow outside, and we'd love to share a big pepperoni. Unfortunately we don't have any big chains nearby, just local pizzerias, but I'm happy to verify, share silly photos, whatever you'd like.
