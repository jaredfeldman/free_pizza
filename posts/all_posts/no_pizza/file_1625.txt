I'm home by myself and I am on house arrest, so I cannot leave my house. I have absolutely nothing to eat in my pantry or my fridge. Just canned pumpkin spice:(. If someone would like to help me out I would be very grateful and will pass the giving along to someone else in need when I have the means to. This is my first request from a fellow Redditor, and actually any food is appreciated. I can provide proof of my ankle bracelet which prevents me from leaving.( On house arrest for too many curfew tickets. Which is bull****.) I will also make you a video of when I receive the pizza and how grateful I am. 


Location details: 
I live in Southern Orange county, San Juan Capistrano area. Close to mission viejo and laguna hills.  

Also, I do not come from a family of money so I would give an honest appreciation to anyone taking any notice to this. I just want some food. My stomach hurts and there's nothing I can do about it. I have no money and no other way of getting food.
