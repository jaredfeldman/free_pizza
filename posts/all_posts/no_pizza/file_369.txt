Its really hot around here, I dont have a fan or AC, and ive been sweating it out.  Last night I came to some rough realizations about some personal things, and I just need a day to sit back and take a day to myself.  Itd be really awesome to get some pizza!  Thanks a bunch for your consideration.

Edit;I live in Pasadena - los angeles area
