Hello fellow Redditors! I'm a longtime lurker of reddit, and was recently informed about this subreddit by a friend who new that I was a little tight in the wallet. My wife and I have been married for just over 9 months, and while many other marriages first year are amazing, ours has not been. A few months before my wedding my parents asked to borrow some money to get out of debt, and being a kind-hearted person/good son. I lent them $5000.00, and told them that they did not have to rush to pay me back. Since that time my wife and I have struggled to make ends meet, my parents have gotten divorced, and I have been unable to hold down a job. This past month I was let go of my job at a pizza place, and had a complete breakdown. In order to pay rent for this month I've sold half of our furniture, our tv, and our car radio. We've barely made rent, but we won't be able to get some groceries until Monday. I'm just hoping someone on here has some sympathy for my wife and I, and we want you all to know that we will pay it forward as soon as we can. Thank you very much, and God Bless!
