I don't really have a sad story or anything to tell, I'm just exhausted and forgot to get groceries.

I've been working my retail job for the last few days straight.  I got off my shift today and made the mistake of getting comfy.  I completely forgot to grab food before heading home.  Other than toasted bread and tap water, my options for dinner are moot.  If someone would be willing to save this tired man a trip out and order some Pizza in my place, you will have firmly restored the faith in humanity that being a retail servant has taken from me.
