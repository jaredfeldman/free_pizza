So, this Christmas, I am living in my car. I will pick up my ten year old daughter from her dad's and go to Starbuck's in our pajamas as per our tradition, and the rest of Christmas is going to be shit. 

I worked in my friend's yarn shop today, and am closing up and starving and broke. When I leave here, I will drive to the rest area up the interstate and work on the commission knitting project I have. 

Everything right now sucks, so I thought I'd give this a shot. It'd really make my night.
