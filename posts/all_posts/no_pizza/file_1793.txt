I'm an employed woman that lives alone, I make enough to take care of myself, but no extras. I am going to visit a friend who is celebrating her youngest's 5th birthday...I bought her a cake, because she spent all of her money on buying him a Yu-Gi-Oh set of cards and toys but I'd really like to show up at the door with dinner for them. I wont be ordering it this very minute, not for a few hours even but there is only a Domino's in our town. Please help and I'll try to send pics! :)

My email address is rainbowsmoothie_elaine@aol.com, I wont be able to check reddit but I should be able to check my email from my cell phone! Hope this works!
