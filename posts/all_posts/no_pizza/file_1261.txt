**Note:** I did post this in the other random act of pizza subreddit first not realizing this was the main one. I have not recieved pizza (or even a comment) there.
 
Hey, thanks for taking the time to read this. I got injured really badly last pay period and was unable to work for nearly two weeks. Normally I would have a back up plan but I just spent a whole bunch of money on a move out of state so that I could finally get my life heading the direction I needed. I have 7 dollars in my checking account and nothing in my savings. I have a six pack of ramen noodles and half an onion and that is every thing that I own as far as food. I have already been surviving off ramen and toast for the last 3 days.
Please help me out. I promise to pay it forward as soon as I am able. I can try and draw you something but my art skills are pretty lacking. I cant think of anything else to barter with if you think of something let me know. Again, thank you for taking the time to read this.

**Edit:** Crap! I realized I didnt add where I am from WA, USA
