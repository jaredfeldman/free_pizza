My boyfriend doesn't get paid until Thursday, we can happily repay someone or something after then. We have a package of Ramen for today, so I would prefer to have any donated food for tomorrow when we will have literally nothing, except 72 cents for cat food... because I'm not about to let her starve! 
Anyway, I don't know much about these reddits but I thought I would give it a chance... I can message with you if you want. Also, it doesn't need to be pizza... we just want something to eat... but we don't have any gas in the car. Please help...
Thank you for at least looking :)

EDIT: I can offer something, I can draw you a picture of anything you want, I can make you a necklace, take a photo, or any other artsy thing! =)
