So, I won't bore you with the gruesome details. Last night, I had a really good time with some friends, and this morning, the charming head of mental illness decided to punch the good times clean out of me. I was awful to the people that I love, and now I'm on my own, too frightened out of my mind of what they think of me to talk to anybody. I probably don't deserve this, but I just need to eat something - I haven't been able to in a few days, and my stomach is making some ungodly noises.

I wouldn't normally ask, but my bank account is already in overdraft, and I don't ask for much - I have a usual order, and it comes to just over a fiver. If anyone could help, I will definitely pay it forward should you ever be in need. God knows, I've got plenty to make up for.
