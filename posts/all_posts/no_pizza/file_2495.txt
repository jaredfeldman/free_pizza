Hey RAOP, we're not starving, but we're strapped this month and we've eaten chicken every way we can think of for almost three weeks straight, trying to stretch the dollars to the max. My niece, nephew and sister have a hankerin for some Dominoes tonight. I'd be grateful for a couple of pies for dinner tonight.
