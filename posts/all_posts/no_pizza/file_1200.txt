I got a new smoker a few weeks ago, and decided I wanted to make beercan chicken for the first time.  I had never used a smoker before, but I had smoked food in normal grills.  Anyway, Walmart only had mesquite and hickory wood chips, which turns out are both terrible.  I couldn't get the smoker to the proper temp, and the smoke "flavor" is one of the worst things I have ever tasted.  Needless to say I wont ever be doing that again.  If you could help out by sending a pizza so I don't have to go to bed on an empty stomach, I would really appreciate it!
