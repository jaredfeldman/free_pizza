I'm a software developer who is working on contract work week to week and this week... things came up slightly short.

My girlfriend has come over to my place for the evening and she just expressed the want for a pizza and as I sit here looking at my bank account I've realized I'm overdrawn for the week thanks to the dentist.

So I've come looking for a pizza. After being a long time Reddit lurker I've registered and decided it is time to see what happens with this.

Don't worry... I'm verified.
