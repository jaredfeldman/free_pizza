I just got a job yesterday but I wont have money for the next 2 weeks for food. Thank you so much in advance for anyone who helps.

Also since I should clarify, the family of five is her and her mom, step dad, step sister, and me. I live here out of necessity since living conditions at my grandmother's house became unlivable for me.
