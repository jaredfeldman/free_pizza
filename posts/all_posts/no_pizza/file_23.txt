Hi RAOP - I just came across this subreddit and think it's a great idea! Just throwing out this request. Been ill for the last couple of days and managed to have a big fight with my dad yesterday, just feeling a bit rough. Would be nice to curl up with a pizza and put a film on and ignore the world for a bit this evening.
