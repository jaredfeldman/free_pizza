I've had ramen 3 times a day for the past 5 days straight, and often more these past few months. Lost my job because my Fiance had a nervous breakdown over her brother dying and I had to take time off to take care of her, and it just got worse and worse and I got fired. Like for coming in tired from dealing with her, etc. Just requesting a pizza for change of pace. Thanks.
