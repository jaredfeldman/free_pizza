Leaving my old stomping grounds of Atlanta to head for greener pastures ( or well , flatter ones i suppose ) . Between the packing and getting a place to live set up im out of readily available cookware and expendable income , was just wanting to try and see if i could get a friendly and memorable send off from a town i love so much. Either or , thanks for the good times atlanta
