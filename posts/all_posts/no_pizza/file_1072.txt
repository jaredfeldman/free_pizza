I haven't seen my best friend in over 5 years. I was finally in the area, and gave him a call, but he lived really far away. I scrounged up all the gas money I could to go see him, and ended up with just enough for there and back. He is a poor college kid, and has no food (his girlfriend and him have an arrangement.) Please help us relive the glory of our teenage years. Message me for address.
