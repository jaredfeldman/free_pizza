Pretty much what the title says. Felt a little stress from the weekend (relationship problems), so I decided to unwind a little bit with some weed. Now I'm feeling the munchies and I realize that I've got no food in the house, and I'm not okay to drive to go out and get money or anything. A pizza would be very appreciated. Located on the East Coast of the US, thanks for your time. Any Ents here?
