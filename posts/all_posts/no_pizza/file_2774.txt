Hey all. I have been a lurker for about 3 years now... this rain has encouraged me to ask you guys for some warm, tasty pizza. Breaking the silence! 

It has been raining here on and off for a few days.. today has made me want to start building an ark. I'm pretty broke, and it's raining so I really don't want to leave my house to walk anywhere to get something to eat. I would pay it forward as soon as I possibly could! &lt;3
