 Stumbled across this subreddit and figured it was worth a shot. My cousin and I moved out on our own a few weeks ago and he is unemployed. I have been paying all bills/ buying all groceries and other expenses. We've been living very meager and haven't eaten out since we moved. We were talking the other day about how we would love a pizza. I anyone would kindly donate we would be very appreciative and would most certainly reciprocate in any way we can.
