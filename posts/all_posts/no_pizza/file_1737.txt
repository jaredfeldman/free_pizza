My roommate and I just had a bad week with rent and utility bills being due. Not wanting to get evicted and not wanting to have our power turned off we had to pay both of them off which has taken all of my money until friday. This unfortunately dipped into both of our grocery funds quite deeply.

If anyone would be so kind to help us out with a pizza, i'm 100% able to return the favor this friday when i get paid.

*edit* i'm in Ohio.
