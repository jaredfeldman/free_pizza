I've been having a stressed out anxiety ridden week. I've had issues with my eating but not bad enough to be considered anorexic. So I've been eating sporadically. Sleeping not so well either. 

I tend to use weed to help me actually want to eat. Well it's not really been working. Been smoking since yesterday and haven't gotten the desire to eat. 

That is until I started thinking about pizza. I think I was even just reading the word pizza. I instantly started fantasizing about pizza. Then hit my brick wall when I remembered I have no money due to 4/20.

I know I need to eat, but I just can't see me putting in the effort to make something I'll actually eat.
