I found out a couple weeks ago that I have Rheumatoid Arthritis. While I wait to start serious treatment, I'm having to give up just about every focal activity in my life- basketball, yoga, alcohol and long nights out. This is making my move to a new city all the more difficult, as you might imagine.
Anyway, I'm hungry, low on food, and too achy to shop and prepare a meal (no real grip function today). I figured it would be worth a shot since I'm just a couple days away from returning the gesture.
