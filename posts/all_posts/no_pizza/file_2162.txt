So, I am 20 years old and for the past two months due to a fight with me and mom, (she didn't wanna fill out my fasfa form so i can get a grant for college), I have been homeless. I don't drive, and I didn't have a job for a while I just recently started working part time at a buffet I don't get paid for another two weeks. I make it day by day with help from my friends, I don't know where I am going to sleep every night, or how I am going to eat. And most of the time I will go without food, But a friend of mine told me about random acts of pizza and how they help people in situations like mine. So, it would help me a lot if someone can help me eat for the week. I don't like asking for things, and I feel dumb because I am asking for food. But its to the point where I don't have very many options. Thanks, &lt;3 Mercedes.
