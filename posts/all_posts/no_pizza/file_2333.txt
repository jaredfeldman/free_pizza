My life has gotten pretty crazy over the past 2 weeks. Two of my good friends are sleeping in my living room (one just got divorced and moved back here from another state, he does some under the table work but is running low on cash. The other has just had some bad luck in life and has had a few offers that look promising, so I'm letting him stay until one goes through.) My boyfriend just started working again after being out of work for a few months, but he doesn't get paid until tomorrow. Rent was due this week and all that's left in my cupboard is cheap canned soup. Pizza would really help the morale around here, and I'll pay it forward at the end if the month (I've got 2 weeks of over time coming up.)
