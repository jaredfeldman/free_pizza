I am a single dad living with my son and sick mother. I recently had to quit my job to stay at home with them because she can't watch him by herself while I work.The last of my money just went on the rest of my bills and we have no money to get any food. If someone could help I would really appreciate it and would return the favor when I am back on my feet.
