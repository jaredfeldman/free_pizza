I'm not starving, or without income. I'm a little broke right now, but there's definitely food in the pantry. But you know what? It's all healthy food. And fuck that. I just really want a pizza. Or as Dr. Steve Brule would say, a prizza. **It makes me really fucking happy.**
See? Look at this pic of me eating pizza! Look how happy I was in that moment!

You, good sir or madame, could make me that happy again. It is within your power! Plus I'd probably take a bunch of photos of myself LOSING MY SHIT over the pizza. It'd be really undignified and manic.
