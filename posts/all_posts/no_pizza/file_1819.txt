I figure that between a pizza and the rice that I have left that I can eat at least until I visit my family for Christmas. I've set aside the money it will take me to catch a bus to join everyone for this "holiday tradition", but buying anymore food will be very tight until about Jan. 2nd, when my next paycheck comes in.
Happy holidays to everyone regardless of anything else. You people are all amazing and I wish you all the best!
