Title kinda says it all. I'm working over break so I don't get to go home until tomorrow night. I work at a restaurant and while everyone else is home for the holidays, my tips have sucked (talking like &lt;$10 a night). I'd for sure pay it forward as soon as I got the chance, I just don't want to spend what little rent money I have on food for the next 2 days.
