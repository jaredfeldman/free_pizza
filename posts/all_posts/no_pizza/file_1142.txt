My girlfriend and I are living in a trailer with my brother while we go to school. If any of you have lived in a trailer, you should know that a little bit of heat goes a long way, especially when there is no AC (which is our case). Turning on the stove or oven raises the temperature to the point where my greatest fear becomes spontaneous combustion. I'd be glad to pay it forward when I can!
