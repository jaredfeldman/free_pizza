I'm a community college student who hasn't had a decent meal in quite some time. I've been eating two or three eggs a day all semester. (the cheapest food really, 2 1/2 dozen for about $4 at my local salvage grocery, that's about 15 cents an egg! Way cheaper and more nutritious than Ramen Noodles!) But I've only two left and after that its a cold water diet until my next paycheck in a week, which is mostly going towards rent and gas. (may have to sell this computer)

I know there are others around the world who are more in need but goodness I sure would love some pizza. As a younger kid, I took good food for granted now it has become a priority and I feel foolish for my prior attitude. If nothing else I would love some words of encouragement or anything that's ever helped you when times got tough. And, if it means anything, I will make a promise to do two Random Acts of Pizza whenever it is a little more plausible.

A big thanks to this subreddit, you guys are a real honor to the internet and the power of kindness! Keep up the good work and if you can't help me please do it for someone else as I know you will! :)
