There's a local hotspot that takes orders until 12:30 AM called [Big E's pizza](http://bigepizza.com)! It's currently 11:22 PM so this is the only reason I mention that.. I'm not sure if anywhere else is still open. We're gonna be playing video games for the next 24 hours and thought some pizza pie would be cool. 

Woo!
