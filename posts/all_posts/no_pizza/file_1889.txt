My mother left for work around 6:30 this morning and will more than likely be home extremely late tonight, being that my cousin is in the hospital &amp; she's gone to see him every day since he's been hospitalized. She left us $20 on the kitchen table, but my sister was called into work &amp; needed cab fair. Now my brother, sister &amp; I have nothing to eat today. We won't die, but help would be greatly appreciated.
