Due to an administrative error, four of us are sitting here folding, stapling, and applying mailing labels to 1,300 newsletters that have to go out for our organization. Oh, these have to be done tonight. We've been working for two hours and expect to be working for four more. Pizza would be spectacular! :)

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/A7wub.jpg) a small portion of our pile of newsletters (sorry for the quality, it's my crappy iPod Touch camera).

You guys rock!

EDIT: We're near Grand Rapids, Michigan.
