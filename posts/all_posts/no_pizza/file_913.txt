I have been going on a downward cycle lately. I've recently lost my mother to cancer. Without me knowing about the loan my mother had taken out a few years ago, my family ended up losing our store. My grandparents put everything they had into that store and it makes me sick to know that it's gone. Depression has kept me away from many things and this includes the day to day business and just knowing how far in the red we were.

I have tried very hard to be a contributing member of society, but after 6 months of no work I am quickly losing hope. The one thing I have wanted for so long involves a tall glass of soda and a thick slice of pepperoni pizza. No matter how I dress up these minute noodles, the taste cannot compare to a delicious slice of pizza. I'm hoping some kind soul out there would be nice enough to treat me to some pizza please. I don't know exactly how this works, but I've been reading and I'm intrigued. Some pizza could definitely cheer me up. Thank you.
