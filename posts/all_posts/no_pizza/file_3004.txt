We are three hungry girls in Brooklyn, jealous of our cats enjoying Friskies Grilled Mix that we spent our last collective $8.49 on. We don't get paid until tomorrow evening! We saw this on a new report a while ago, so we aren't exactly sure how to use it, but it sounds like all you have to do is return the favor! We can do it tomorrow! Can any kind soul help out there?? Attached below is my bank account to prove it! It's been a rough week!

Thanks so much and we love you!

-Chelsea, Elsie, Mel(sea), and the cats
