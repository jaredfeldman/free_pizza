I got a good 40 miles in during the 4-5 hours of sunshine on Friday, but the steady on/off of rain around the state has kept me out of the saddle the rest of the week. I haven't had a delivery pizza in over a month after getting serious about my diet, but I've been drooling thinking about crispy pepperonis and stringy cheese lately. I could use a cheat day, would anybody like to help quell these cravings?
