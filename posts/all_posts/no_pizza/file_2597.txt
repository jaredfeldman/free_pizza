I moved to nyc for the summer in order to complete an digital effects internship and am currently working that and 2 other jobs waiting tables/bar backing in order to stay afloat. This city has been tearing me apart financially on top of my college loans and I would greatly appreciate the help of ROAP to help fill my belly with delicious pizza as opposed to the ramen noodles and cheese sandwiches I've become accustom to.
