I got laid off on Monday from my blue-collar job I've had for years. My boss said that it's hopefully a temporary cost-cutting measure,
 and I'll probably be hired back in the fall when production picks up, and I believe him. Things always pick back up in the fall.

 I have a little bit of money saved up, but I stress about the long term.
 
For the last year, it's just been me and my 2 wonderful girls, A. (6) and P.(9).  Their mom left last year due to with her drug abuse (First perscription opiates, then heroin). After 3 rounds of 28-day 
treatment (one of them court-ordered), I kicked her out... I had to, I couldn't bear to have the girls see her in the state she was in 99% of the time; if not high, then dope-sick and angry. She occasionally will pop up and visit, but I know she's still using.

Long story short: My kids aren't exactly starving, but they havent had a pizza night with dad in quite a long time. I'm hoping we can sit on the floor as a family in front of the tv, put in "How to Train Your Dragon", chow down, and forget about stuff for a couple of hours. 

P.S. Obvious throwaway, I didn't want to post with my regular account, as I'm a regular poster/commenter, and not a lurker.
