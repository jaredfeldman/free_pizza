My mother lives in the area effected by the giant little bear fire in New mexico and is waiting to hear if she has a place to live or is coming back to New York to live with me. My father lost his job several month ago and is also likely about to move in with me. These two have been divorced for 20+ years and as much as i love them I have no idea if I can handle that. So I'm sitting here stressed out already wondering if I have enough to survive this economic hellstorm myself, let alone save my parents. I would love a pizza right now.
