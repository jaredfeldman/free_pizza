Out of work right now. Looking for a new job. Got home last night, ate lasagna, went to bed and woke up puking into my trashcan around 4 hours later. I've spent all day in bed feeling like shit instead of out applying at places. I only have 200 bucks in my account and I have no idea how long that'll have to last me. I'd be willing to repay the favor with my first paycheck.

Because I live in a guest house Dominos is a must. The pizza tracker tells me when to expect delivery and go to the main house, meaning I can wait in bed while it's cooking.
