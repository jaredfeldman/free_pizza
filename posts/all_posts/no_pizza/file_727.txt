I'm a lurker, not a poster, so I'm not expecting much - but I thought I'd try my hand anyway! I really should go for a proper English breakfast, but I massively wrecked my knee when I was wrecked last night and now I can't even make it round the corner to the shop. No worries if it doesn't happen! Cheers :)
