Could really use a pizza while I work on assignments after work tonight. This week has been hell. My "friend" moved to Ontario with a bunch of my shit. Been working full time, but still only have 8 bucks left after paying my rent. Finals are fast approaching, as well as the deadlines for my university assignments. This and my work week isn't slowing down. Could just use the pick me up after work tonight I guess.
