I'm in Ohio. This would be a surprise for my niece since she's craving it. She's in 6th grade and busy playing PC games to escape the craziness.

Editing for info:

Google tells me its "Paradise, NV". This would have to be a delivery (personal or by pizza delivery service).

Mom moved out there to marry a millionaire. He passed away. The money's all gone. She can't physically work. She's been through a lot more than this, but this whole situation makes her feel lost. She's a trooper, though.

Sis moved out there because she needed help taking care of her daughter.

I'm in Ohio living with my boyfriend and his family as we both attempt to get (new) jobs and get into college. I moved out here when I was 22, I'm 24 now.

Mom can't pay the bills, and I'm trying to get her involved in community things. My sister applied for state assistance and is waiting for it. They have a bit of elbow pasta, ketchup and some bread. She wanted me to call my dad, so I went to reddit lol. My niece needs the ROAP, and my sister &amp; mom need to eat.
