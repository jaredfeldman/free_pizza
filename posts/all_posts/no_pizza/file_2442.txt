Just got my first job at a dry cleaners and I have only eaten a single grilled cheese sandwich all week. Boss doesn't want to pay me for the first week so I'm broke tell next week! As soon as I get my pay check I will buy someone a pizza! PLEASE HELP!

PM me please. I've been browsing reddit for years and I really need some help right now, Thanks!
