Tomorrow is my best friend's birthday and lately she's been going through a financial rut. She and her mother live alone in a small house which they've been paying out the ass for. There have been many instances where I'll intentionally over bake something so I can give the extra to her and her mother. Unfortunately, I don't have the funds to buy her a pizza myself since I splurged on another gift I thought she might like.
