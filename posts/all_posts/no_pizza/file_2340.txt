Let me start off by saying that I've read some of the posts here a few times and have always wanted to give someone a pizza. 

I lost my job over 4 months ago, right before my wedding. We had an idea that it was going to happen so we saved up some money. Our savings and my wife's job have been enough to pay the bills for the last 4 months. But that money has run out. 

Last week I was lucky enough to find a part time job but I haven't started it yet. My wife and I have no money right now and have been eating hot dogs and ramen for the last week (seriously, 7 days). We could both really go for not-a-hot-dog for dinner.

Thanks for everything RAOP!

**EDIT** I Should say that I'm in Upstate NY.
