As the title says, I'm currently 17, and living with my Mom that recently kicked Cancer's ass (I am completely unsure what type of Cancer it was/is) but she's having a tough time keeping a job and we barely have any food to eat. I don't really know of a way to prove this for some of the people that may or may not believe me.

Just hoping someone would be kind enough to send a Pizza our way, this was kind of a last resort, to "ask" or "beg" for food.

Anyways, Thanks for taking the time into reading this.
