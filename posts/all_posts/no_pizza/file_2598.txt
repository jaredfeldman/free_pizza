My names Marcus and I live in Georgia. Basically I got uninvited to a dinner party tomorrow and I'm stuck out of luck in the food department until Sunday. I got some tuna but no bread or mayo, 2 cans of chef boyardee, a few hamburger pattys but no buns, and a can of black beans. That's the literal contents of my fridge and pantry, and while it's better than nothing at all like some folks have I'm a little less than thankful this year.

My mom died last year and I'm still paying out of pocket to get everything situated with that. If I have any other family I don't know them so spending the holidays with anyone is out of the question. My girlfriend went up to Tennessee but I couldn't get off work so eating with her family is out of the question. And my best friend of over three years told me flat out today his wife doesn't want me to come because her parents are going to be there. So for the first time in my life I'm completely alone on turkey day and it's depressing the heck out of me.

So yeah, no family or friends or money means no black olives, turkey, gravy, those little marshmallows, etc for me tomorrow. Any way I could score some pizza money today so I can get some wings or something? I'd much rather warm something up tomorrow than eat a can of plain tuna or some lousy canned spaghetti. Thanks for any help or well wishes you might offer.
