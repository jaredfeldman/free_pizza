i am a single mother of 2 who recently lost my job. we are on such a tight budget &amp; unable to afford to eat anything other than hot dogs ramen n mac n cheese. waiting on assitance &amp; employers seems to take forever when u r so desperate &amp; have to provide for 2. my sons would love some pizza since this is unaffordable for us. thank you so much for your kindness. happy 4th!
