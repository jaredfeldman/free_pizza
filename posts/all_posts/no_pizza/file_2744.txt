Ordered 2 NFL football jerseys and like any hardcore fan, I was jubilant at the thought of finally wearing my team jerseys with pride! That is...until they were stolen off my porch after being delivered. I'm really bummed because they were quite a bit of money (for me at least). A pizza would help alleviate the problem a little.
