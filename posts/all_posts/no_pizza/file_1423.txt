First time on Random Acts of Pizza, my wallet was stolen out of my car today and I am in a very miserable mood.  I am hungry and if someone would be so kind to give me a random act of pizza I would be very grateful.  In the future when I am in a more financially stable position I will remember the generosity and pass on the good deeds. BTW I &lt;3 Dominos pizza. Thanks!
