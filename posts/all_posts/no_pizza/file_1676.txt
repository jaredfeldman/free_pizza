EDIT: Forgot to include location, which is CHICAGO SUBURBS!

My parents just went out to dinner, and I just realized that we aren't getting groceries until tomorrow, so I'm prettttty hungry.  These allergies are pretty awful, but I have some unfinished video games that I can revisit while I'm here, so it's not all bad.  But can you awesome people of RAoP make it better?  :D  It would make my night to be saved by reddit. 

P.S. I've never done this before, so I don't really know how the verification system works.  I'd be happy to use it if you explained it to me though :)
