Heyo-

It pains me to write this, on a non-throwaway, no less. I'm really struggling with money right now. I spent Christmas alone (I just moved here and all of my family/friends are 1400 miles away) and am now spending New Year's Eve alone because I can't afford to go out (and... I know no one). 

Here's some proof that I am... uh... I guess, a person named Hamburglary? http://imgur.com/efW2d

If you would send a pizza my way for supper I would be FOREVER IN YOUR DEBT. We have a Pizza Butt local to here and that would be juuuust fine (and you can order online etc so that I never need to know your cc info, etc, so on, so forth). 

Thanks for reading/thinking about it, and have a great New Year's Eve!
