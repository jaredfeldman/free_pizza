I was referred here by a redditor I am good friends with on IRC. I am currently starting my own business, so I've been living paycheck to paycheck due to new expenses. I don't have any checks coming in until next week. I spent the last of my money to buy a bag of food for my dog so he doesn't go hungry. Any help would make the next couple days much less miserable.
