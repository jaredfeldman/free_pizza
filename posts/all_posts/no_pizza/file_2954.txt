Hey all.

Didn't get to eat much for dinner last night and I am not getting paid until tomorrow. Could really use a pie for lunch, I'll even share it with coworkers. *Pay it forward* right?

I'm not sure exactly how this system works, first timer. I did the verification code thing but it says not to post in thread.

There's a couple pizza places really close to my work where I can go pick it up on my lunch break (anywhere from noon to 1pm). I'm eastern time zone. 

* Neighhood Pizza Company: 905.984.5555
* Boston Pizza: 905.688.0273


Thanks for looking!
