EDIT: I don't need the pizza now. I got it taken care of. 

My friends and I are going to have a pizza party for the Oscars tonight and I was going to use the free pizza I had saved for the coin toss. So I go on to the papa john's website to order my pizza to pick on the way to my friends house tonight but it tells me "The promo code you entered has exceeded the maximum allowed usage" but I haven't used it yet. I called customer service but I got a busy signal. After a few tries, I gave up. Because it's my cake day and I love the Oscars, I thought someone might have sympathy for me. 

But, if someone thinks I can get this fixed once I get a hold of customer service, I'll keep trying but I don't know how to prove I didn't already use it. I mean, my order history will be blank bc I created the account to use the code but other than that, I don't know what to tell them. If I can get this fixed then I won't need/accept an offer from you guys. 

EDIT: Finally got through to customer service and we got it worked out. They gave me a new code. Thanks to anyone who considered helping me out. I'll try to pizza someone in the future when I have the means.
