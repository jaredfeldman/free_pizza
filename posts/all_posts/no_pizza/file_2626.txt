Hello guys, This time of the year is really rough on me, I had to find a 6 month long internship. I found it but I used all my monies on stamps, letters bus tickets and calls (200 places called woohoo !).
I could use a tasty tasty pizza tonight (it's ~9pm right now in France).
I posted another sumission 2 hours ago and it seems that it ended up in the spam filter, let me know if I should delete this one.
Have a great day !
