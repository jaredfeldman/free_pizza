Just down on my luck.  I lost my job and am struggling  to make ends meet. The kids and I would love some pizza. I will also pass it along once I am on my feet. I tried this before but no luck lol  Umm dont know what else to say.  HAPPY 4th of July!  I hope this works this time, but if not I understand there are many in need and I think this board is a great idea and hope it stays around a long time. You ppl are truely nice ppl and I wish you all the best.
