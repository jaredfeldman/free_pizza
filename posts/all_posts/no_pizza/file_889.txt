To whom it may concern,

Hi there, my name's Melissa. I'm a 22 y/o mom/student at Ohio State. Things have been going well in school, but with summer classes the bills have been building up. I haven't had a chance to go to the store and my son has been asking for pizza all week. I hate to deny him but pizza is so cost-ineffective for me it's hard to say yes and not feel a bit guilty afterwards. If anyone would be willing to help out a good cause I'd appreciate it.
