I ate a part of a left over salad last night and I haven't eaten anything since. I will continue to be in this situation until I can be able to take the money I work hard for to set some aside to put a little bit of groceries in my home of 7 people. I am one of 3 people working to pay bills so that there is electricity in it and a working phone, ect. I have no where else to turn and I am in need of help. I hate feeling this desperate and could use a helping hand this once. thank you.
