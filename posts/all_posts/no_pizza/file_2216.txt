I am a mother of two a 3 yr old and a 5 month old we are in tough times living at my mothers house trying to find a place to live. I am a stay at home mother while my fiancee works a full time minimum wage job to try to scrape by. due to the past few tough weeks my mother has decided that we have to leave by the beginning of august. I have just spent the last of our food stamps and money on our baby boy to buy him formula.  we are broke stressed out and in need of someone to raise our spirits.
