I don't know what else to say. Iv been cooking for myself for awhile now (crappy soup, sometimes Hamburger Helper, and lots of rice) and would really like something that tastes good. I can provide proof of..me I guess or whatever. Thanks for considering. 

**Edit:** Oh and the pipes to my shower or something are leaking...
