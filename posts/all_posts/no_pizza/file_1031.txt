Wrapping up my last semster of college, amongst working part time and getting paid bi-weekly I have no food at home to speak of, what with an empty fridge and bare cabinets my hunger grows to an inmeasurable depth. Can a fellow anon help a redditor out by putting some pizza in their growling stomach. I will return the favor when my part time job pays me at the end of the month.
