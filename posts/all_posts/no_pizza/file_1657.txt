I'm a full time photography student, and I really don't have money to spare. My brother pre-ordered Skyrim for me and I'd love some pizza for when I play on Friday evening. I know I'm not as down on my luck as some other posters, but I have a pretty good knowledge of photoshop and I'll do my best to fulfill any requests for pizza!
