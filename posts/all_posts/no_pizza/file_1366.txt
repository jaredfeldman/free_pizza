I'm 18 years old and I graduate this summer from high school. After a heated conversation with my parents I told them that I was an atheist. Being super religious, this did not go over well with them. Instead of loving their child unconditionally, they decided to kick me out of the house. (Thinking back on everything, I probably should have waited till I was in my college dorm later this year).


Anyway, I've been staying in an extra room at a friends house. They're gone for a week and I thought at least try here. A pizza can hold me over for a few days till I can get my small part time job pay check.
