Title says it all. Cupboard is low on food. I`m tired, wasn't supposed to work today but Chef decided to give his pet Czech the day off and called me into work in his place. My co-worker rambled about the joys of cold pizza for like an hour so its all I can think about but, I am broke for a week.
I will of course pay it forward once I have money. I used to send my GF pizzas while she was down in New Mexico at university, so this is just a broader spectrum of hungry hungry hippies to share with.
