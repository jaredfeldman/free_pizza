I'm a host that works a food service job that doesn't offer a discount or allow you to eat in their restaurant. I'm part of the only dept. in the restaurant that doesn't get tips. I just worked OT on my Friday (which I won't see a penny of until payday next week) and I have two packets of ramen to subsist on, currently, with about $1.29 in the bank. I'm hungry. :(  I can provide some modicum of proof if needed, and I will eagerly return the favor someday  if anyone would be willing to help out. Thank you, and my grumbling tummy thanks you.
