Hello good folks of RoaP! I have heard of this mythical land where kind redditors help other redditors eat the most wondrous of foods and I figured "Hey, I'm a broke redditor who enjoys pizza. It's worth a shot!"

I won't bore/lie to you about how I'm homeless, jobless, deaf, or anything silly. I am simply a kind redditor of just over a year who would humbly like some pizza. As soon as I am able, I will gladly pay it forward in the future (Paydays are Wednesdays!)

All the same, thanks so much to you kind folks, and keep up the random acts of deliciousness.
