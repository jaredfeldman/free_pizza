I wake up this morning thinking I would be receiving my normal work emails, but to my surprise this was waiting in my inbox. I know work has slowed down, but I didn't think I would be getting the axe. A pizza would sure bring me up from this low blow. I am not picky, any type would be fine with me. Thank you for reading.

Sorry the link didn't show up. I'll try to repost it. [I hope this shows up](http://imgur.com/RqYGw).
