I'm excited for leaving school, and I feel like a way to celebrate. eing a high school student, I haven't got a job, otherwise I'd go out and buy ingredients for pasta.

(Y'know, come to think of it, I know the whole notion of "going into the big wide world" and "pizza delivered right to your door" is a big oxymoron :P )

I've never done a RAOP before, so I'm not sure if countries matter. I'm in Australia (New South Wales, Sydney, to be exact).

I'm a big believer in "do good, get good" and "giving &gt; recieving", so I'll return the favour to a random redditor next week once I scrap up some change!
