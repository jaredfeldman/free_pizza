I'm hiding behind this throwaway account because I am embarrassed to ask for help again. We've received pizza before when we were homeless a couple months back. However we moved recently in our new apartment and were already late on rent so all our money went towards bills. My father is lending us gas money tomorrow to get to the food pantry but today I'm not sure what we are going to do. 

My husbands father is staying a couple weeks with us because he wasn't getting the proper care where he lives at. He has heart problems and is diabetic, and he has to eat which makes me feel terrible because we had to pay a more big of a late fee then I thought and I feel that we are letting him down by us as well not giving him the proper care he needs.   

We have no children so I can understand if we aren't helped.

However, if someone does help, I can give them my real account name, and I wouldn't mind taking a picture as well, whatever works.

Thanks.
