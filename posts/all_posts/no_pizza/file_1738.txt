First things first: I'm twenty and I live with my mother. In tennessee. There's pretty much a whole lot of things out of reach for me due to the fact of residential areas being in the asscrack of nowhere.
I'm an amateur game developer who's studying to actually start developing but can't really do that without fuel for attentionspan. It's complicated.
Anyway, if you send me pizza, I'll credit you by reddit username in obnoxiously huge, flashing letters in my first kongregate submission, Snap into a genocide (whose gameplay is completely unrelated to the title).
And if you're a pretty rad dude for lack of a better agendered word, we can be friends.
and-- while I would love any pizza, pizza hut's kinda gross in this area.
I live in shannon glen, which is in spring hill. I encourage you to googlemaps it and see why I'm requesting. Thanks!
