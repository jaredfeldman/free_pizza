So my coworker's lunch got stolen. I felt bad for him since it had happened to me before (we work in a fairly big building with lots of strangers coming though so theft happens). I offered to help him get another one and even to go pick it up for him. Apparently this is tantamount to admission of guilt? Next thing i know I'm being accused of being the dastardly pizza thief.  

I haven't even had pizza in ages, but if anyone has a spare pie id love to be caught with some evidence. :3
