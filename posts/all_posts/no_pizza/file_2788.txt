Hey RAOP. I never thought I'd be here posting. But my week has been terrible. I don't want any sympathy so I will try to keep it sweet and short. 
I got laid off Friday, and I'm going to go apply for unemployment until I get back on my feet. I plan on stopping by the pantry Wednesday (next day they are open). I thought the pantry was open today but they are not. I have a 3 year old and that is the only reason why I am posting. 
I know posting from a throwaway is frowned upon, but I truly cannot work up enough nerve to reveal my identity. However if someone is willing to help I can give my picture ID, my active accounts name or anything else that's requested.
