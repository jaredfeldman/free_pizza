Fact is, no food in house. We requested a local Food Bank provide some and have to wait several days. Alas, empty stomach is now.

First time asking help here, insofar right now because things escalated. I am looking for/without work temporarily, my roommate got laid off yesterday.

Hundredthoughts of please and thank you.
