Hello everyone. I just heard about this site through one of my friends. I have been struggling with my finances as I am a newly single mom, I have a 10 month old daughter. My friend told me about this site, and said that she had received a pizza when she was in need, and that it really helped her. I figured I would give it a try. I know I just registered on Reddit, and that many people will see that as a bad thing, but i'll do anything to prove that i'm real.

My husband and I just got a divorce. My daughter and I moved into our own apartment, and I am trying to get back on my feet. I am in the midst of getting things in order with Job and Family Services, but until then i'm broke.

So, if anyone can help, that would be great! When I get back on my feet, I will surely pay it forward.
