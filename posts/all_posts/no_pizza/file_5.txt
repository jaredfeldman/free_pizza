We're in Tampa Florida...moving to Ybor on Friday. My email is usfstuff@yahoo.com, since I'm having major trouble figuring out reddit's message system.


My two roommates and I have found a new place to live and are moving in on Friday. The rent is $1100 including utitilies and internet. My 2 roomies have very nicely offered for me to just pay $200 a month until I have a job. I am so thankful to have them as friends! This month all of us are extremely poor from paying $2000 to landlord (first+last rent+deposit). We also had to pay $310 for TECO to turn on the electricity.


I would just really love to do something nice for them and pick them up a pizza and a sub/pzone. My one roomie doesn't love pizza and she only ever gets a sub/pzone haha. Using a few coupons, I can get 8 pizza rollers, 1 large pizza, and a pzone for $11 from Pizza Hut. If anyone can help me out I would be so grateful! Pizza Hut is just the cheapest, if you have something else in mind let me know. I have an interview on Thursday so keep your fingers crossed!
