Today has been so bad today. On my way to work my battery light came on.. later on I found out my alternator went bad. Then on my way home my car died on the side of the road and I had to use the last bit of money to tow it home. I dont know yet how Im gonna get to work tomorrow. A pizza would really make this day better for me if anyone out there can help at all... I'll give you a kiss on the cheek :)
