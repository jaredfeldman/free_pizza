My wife and I have gone through hell after the birth of our son. Wife is suffering from postpartum psychosis, and getting screened for possible lupus. This has been needless to say very stressful. I have a promising job interview tomorrow and could use a delicious pizza instead of another night of ramen. I will pay it forward as soon as I can, either through work, or TANF.
