Hey guys! This is my first post on here and I wanted to tell you that people like you restore my faith in humanity. I am a broke college student who is working his way through college. My family supports me, but can not give me money at this time.  I work a full time job at a minimum wage place just to get my tuition and rent. Things are a little tight for money since the new school year is coming up. So i came to you guys who might have a little extra money to throw at us poor people. I could really use a hot pizza from where ever and it would be much appreciated! Thanks!
