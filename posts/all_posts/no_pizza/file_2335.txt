I'm 17. and I live in Akron, OH with an angry father, my mother passed away 2 years ago and my siblings have all moved out.  

I don't have any money at the moment, which is why I'm here, and I don't have a camera, so I can't document the task I complete unless it involves something in particular that would somehow be accessible.  But I will give you my word that I will do the task, anything for a pizza!
