Background: Health insurance got cancelled because left old job, new job didn't start for a while, started in that magical time frame that allowed me to go way too long without a paycheck and COBRA wants 900 dollars so she can get her shots to continue to finish her education. 

So, I'd really LOVE for her to fill up on a yummy pizza.  If this works, I love the internet. If it doesn't, I still love the internet!

We're just north of Philadelphia, PA
