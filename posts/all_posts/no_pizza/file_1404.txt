I'm broke till next Friday, but I'm in such a need of a pizza right now!  No sob story here; I have food at my apartment, but I don't think any of it is gonna hit the spot like a nice slice right about now.  And I really want something to help with hangover right now.

If this works I plan on paying forward Friday.  If you wanted to determine the criteria for the pizza I give away I would be game for that!
