I've never done this before, but between today, registering for classes for my return to school for the first time in 3 years...it's been an extremely long day. I'd love to swing by Pizza Hut on the way home.

Thanks, guys.

**Edit:** Oops. North Carolina, USA here!

**Edit 2:** Well it's quitting time, so I'll revoke my pizza request until another time.
