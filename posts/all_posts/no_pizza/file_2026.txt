Hey chaps,

I've been having a difficult time recently with my layoff, and it's honestly been a while since I've been able to get take out. So, any fine chaps and lasses want to help a fellow Redditor out? I'll compensate once I get my tax refund back in the future if that's incentive too :)

Cheers!
