After rent, my portion of the utilities and a few groceries, I have less than a dollar in my checking account. I get paid every other Friday and this is an off week. I did grocery shop, so I won't starve, but there is only so much ramen (with egg and sricha!) that one can take . tonight is my night to hunker down and do all the homework. So if any kind soul wants to spot me for some pizza tonight, that'd be pretty awesome. :)
