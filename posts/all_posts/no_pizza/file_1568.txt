What sounds like a pathetic sob story, is actually true. I was a merchandiser that got laid off from my company on 11/20. So, no money flow. I had three classes I needed to finish to grad with my degree and, like an idiot, I missed my last final and now my teacher has already gone out of the country (she's Indian and won't be back till 2 weeks from today). I can take screen shots to prove all this if you don't believe me. Basically, I'm having a pretty terrible holiday season.

Figured it was worth a shot here to get a pizza to lift my spirits. If you donate, whenever I get a job or take that final, I will send you a pizza AND BREADSTICKS!!@#!@!!! Also, if you want to ask me one question about the moon, I can answer that.

Thanks either way and we should have a jumping high five in 3....2.....1
