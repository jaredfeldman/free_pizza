Would adore a pizza this evening, haven't had any lunch and I do not think I can face plain pasta or rice for the 4th day in a row.

I have exactly enough money for bus fare to work tomorrow and Wednesday and that it, all my spending for the past 2 weeks has been calculated exactly so obviously no frivolous pizza buying! Would love a pizza whilst I pack up my room tonight ready to move back home at the weekend. (End of university)

I've wanted to buy someone on here a pizza for a while and I would love to do so (UK) on Thursday night!
