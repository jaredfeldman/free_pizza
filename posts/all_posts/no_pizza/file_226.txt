I've been hit hard with medical bills, insurance bills, and utilities, resulting in becoming completely broke.  If someone was willing to send a pizza my way it would go a long way, I'd make make whatever sent last for at least a week or more.  If anyone can help that would be most awesome and I'd try my best to help others on here when I financially can.
