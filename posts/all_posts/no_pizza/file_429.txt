I live in the UK, and my brother has recently moved to Dubai. I recently made a facebook post saying I was getting pizza, and asking who else wanted some. My brother said he was in, and I intend to fulfil his request. I did try to get him the pizza myself, but I couldn't find any pizza places in Dubai that did online ordering, and I couldn't call them because I don't speak Arabic. Help me, Random Acts of Pizza, you're my only hope!
