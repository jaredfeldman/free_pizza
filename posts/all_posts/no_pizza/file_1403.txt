This has been the worst week of my life.

Monday, my grandmother died.

Tuesday, I spend all day getting affairs in order to go out of town for a few days. Important to note that, on this day, I lose my driver's license.


Wednesday morning, I'm having trouble finding my passport, and I end up making my ride to the airport late for work.


Thursday goes off without a hitch!! Luckily!


Friday, there's a lot of last minute things to do for the funeral this morning. My mom asks me to take her car to go pick up the dress Nana will wear for the funeral. I decide to grab some food while I'm out. When the girl is handing me my food, I drop the bag. Awesome. Love Friday.


Today, immediately after the funeral. I get dropped off at the airport (5 hours away) and go to check in, only to realize I've missed my flight by 4 hours. I just checked into a hotel near the airport. 




I'm just asking for something small. My credit card is under so much stress right now, and I really can't afford to put more money on it without breaking my ability to make a payment this month. 


Also, my nephew used my cell phone this morning, and logged me out. I have no idea what my account's password is until I can look on the computer tomorrow morning. I'd be happy to provide some other verification though.
