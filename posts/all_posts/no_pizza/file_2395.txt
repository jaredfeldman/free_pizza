First time trying this out. Here goes nothing.

Did my taxes today, and I owe over 2k for last year.

I already work 2 jobs, 70+ hours a week, with student loan bills near 1k a month. No way I could work much more than I do now. Just had to inform my two great friends/roommates that I need to move out of our house and back to my parents' house to save the money up in time. The move would change my 10 minute commute to near an hour, and push me further from my girlfriend.


Shit, could I use a pizza right now.
