Hi we are a family of 6 and would love some pizza tonight . My husband has been out of work since october due to an auto accident , we get a check once a month towards lost wages but it doesn't go to far . We're hoping he can get back to work soon , but for now the roof over our head is more important than food in the fridge. we live in upstate NY , can provide proof . Thanks in advance.
