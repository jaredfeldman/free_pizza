Hi, I'm new here obviously, found this through a random acts of kindness group I participate in.  My family has had a rough patch the last few months, we had some friends stay with us for what was supposed to be a couple weeks but turned into a couple months where they took advantage of us and basically left us in a really bad place financially because they broke our furniture, took almost all of our childrens toys and really didn't help pay for anything except about $600 in groceries a month when they were a family of 6 not very small people.  Needless to say though we're in the last week of the month and our kids have been troopers through all this and we'd really like to get them a special pizza treat but only have $4 to our name.  My husband and I have 2 beautiful kids a 6 year old girl and 2 year olf boy. Starting next month we'll also have my 9 year old stepson and hopefully by then we will have finished recovering financially from all this.  Thank you ahead of time and we look forward to giving the gift of Pizza to someone else who could use it or needs it on the first. We are in Colorado.
