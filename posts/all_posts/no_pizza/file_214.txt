An Xmas party tradition is being rekindled by some of my friends tonight and it would be great if there were some pizza there to soak up whatever it is we'll be drinking. We're mainly students and/or poor loveable folk, we would really appreciate something pizza based tonight :).


 Will of course pizza it forward in the new year when my student loan comes through
