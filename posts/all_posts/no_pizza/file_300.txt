So broke:(I'm from vista,CA moving to Boston in about a week, but I seriously have no money and have to figure out how I'm gonna get by until then. I don't really have any friends to help me out otherwise I wouldn't be so flipping hungry!!! 
    I hate asking favors but if there's anyone out there who could help a brother out, I would be eternally grateful! As a sign of good faith I will even make an art piece dedicated to my pizza
