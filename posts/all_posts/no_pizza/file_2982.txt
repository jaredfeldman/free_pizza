So, I'm stuck at work (a lan center in Grand Rapids, MI) since 7pm yesterday because of a lack of relief shift, and I have to work until 10am tomorrow*. I haven't had a chance to go home and pick up more food, and there's nothing in the work fridge, and I'm broke until payday next week. I ate the last of my lunch recently, so I won't need anything until later (11pm-12am or so, though I'm happy to stick it in the fridge if nothing's open that late). I'm more than happy to pay back a specific person next week on payday, or to just spread the love around to others when I can.

(* I volunteer, and spending this long down here doesn't bother me; I really do love helping out here. We lack employees that actually care, so I'm happy to take up the slack. I just lack the food to keep me going, is all.)
