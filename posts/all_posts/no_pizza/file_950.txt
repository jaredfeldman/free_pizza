Jobless, just paid rent (woohoo!), and need to pay few grand in taxes. It's been really tough to make ends meet these days. Which also means I've been eating rice and beans twice a day, every single day.

Last night I dreamed about eating pizza, with its warm sauce and melty cheese. Today I get to eat...you guessed it...more rice! Yay! 

I try to stay upbeat about what's been going on, but sometimes it's just hard to keep smiling. Some real-life pizza would make this gloomy NYC afternoon much brighter. It really would make all the difference to me.

And of course, I'd love to pay it forward when my situation improves.
