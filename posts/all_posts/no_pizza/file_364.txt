My lease on my apartment is up tomorrow afternoon and I have nowhere to live aside from my car for the next two weeks. I have no money because my last pay check went into rent and medical bills after having to get my tooth knocked out a few months back, so I've got nothing until next week. Pizza would be great and itll be the last time i get to use my current address lol. Hopefully someone can help me out.
