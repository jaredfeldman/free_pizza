My Girlfriend and I are down on our luck and getting desperate. I lost my job at the start of the summer and we've been floating by just barely managing to keep the rent covered. We've both been looking for jobs very actively, just haven't had any luck at all. We've got a bit of cash on the way next week, but no money until then. Not complaining about all that, but we haven't eaten in nearly three days and we're getting damn hungry. I'm more than happy to repay this favor in the future if someone would help us out tonight.
