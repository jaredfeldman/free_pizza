So I just moved out to Denver for a job that I then lost (was hard working with some of the other employees, and the company was going in a bad design direction).  I was lucky enough to get another job within a week but i'm now between paychecks.

I have $100 on the Envato Market place I can exchange for pizza.  I'll double the cost of the pizza in return.

    If you don't know about Envato, they run these amazing sites:
    http://themeforest.net/ - Really nice website and wordpress themes.
    http://codecanyon.net/  - PHP scripts/classes and WordPress plugins, jQuery and Javascript stuff.
    http://audiojungle.net/ - Music and sound fx for movie or game production.  
    http://videohive.net/   - After Effects projects scenes and other video assets.
    among others you can navigate to from any of their sites. 

I make money selling items on CodeCanyon but they pay out on the 15th once a month.

I'll purchase any item or items you want up to around $60 ( so around $30 in pizza ), how much is up to you.


I would much rather have pizza than hamburger helper without any hamberger (hamberger is expensive you know).
