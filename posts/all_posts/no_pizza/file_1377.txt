Hello, I was thrown through some hoops at my old job, which resulted in me not working for a whole month (without any heads up that i would not be working). I was smart with what money I had left and paid my next months rent and groceries. I am starting to run out of food now and will not be able to purchase any for another week. If anyone would be kind enough to brighten my day with a pizza, I would GREATLY appreciate it and pass on the good deed once I get back on my feet.
