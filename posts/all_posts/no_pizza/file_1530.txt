I am a complete wimp when it comes to the dentist, to the point where I get IV sedation for something as simple as a routine checkup, even though it really doesn't seem to help. Today will be my first ever root canal so needless to say I am extremely nervous because of all of the "horror stories" I have heard from others who have had root canals.

A pizza obviously wouldn't make me any less nervous about the dentist but it would help make my day a bit better and would be very much appreciated. I promise to pay it forward when I start working in a few weeks.
