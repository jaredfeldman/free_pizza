I'm a student who lives off a mix of my student loans and funds from my summer job. I got laid off 3 weeks ago and since it's summer, I have no school money coming in and am trying to stretch what little money I have left. This means a steady diet of rice, beans and ramen and I'm dieing for some variety. I can send some proof in a PM if requested.
