Feels really strange to ask.. but, long story short, I went to visit friends this weekend up at SDSU in Brookings, SD, and after checking my bank account, I saw a nice 900 dollar deduction... from a payment made in February.
I return back to Lincoln, NE in a couple days, and I can make it gas wise.. but if someone can spare a 5 dollar pizza hut calzone or something, i'd love it. Love. Probably couldn't eat it, because I'd marry it.. but it'd just be an elaborate ploy to get to the rest of it's family.
If you can't give, words of encouragement are nice too. I can try to eat those.
