Hey, i'm new to this but my friend just told me about this site. I have just moved to Centralia and got my apartment. I spent all my money for rent and have no money until the 12th. It'd be highly appreciated if someone would be able buy me a Large Pepperoni Pizza from Dominos and I will be able to pay you back. Please and thank you.
