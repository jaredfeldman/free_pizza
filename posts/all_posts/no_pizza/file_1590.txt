As the title says, my GF is leaving me. We've been together for years. I'm pretty torn up. I quit my job and left all my friends behind to move to this city with her after she got a job offer here, and it's been a nightmare since I got here.

I came down here and interviewed, was drug tested, and filled out paperwork for a job before I ever moved here. However once I got here they told me they couldn't hire me because of a hiring freeze. I've been unemployed for 2 months and it is terrible - I've not had a gap in employment for 5 years. My girlfriend thinks I am a loser despite my taking care of our 3 cats and dog, doing all the household chores, and applying for many jobs and going to interviews. I supported her when she was unemployed in the past, but she does not care.

In addition my car is going to be fixed Friday, which I desperately need so I can continue looking for work after my girlfriend leaves me. I owe the mechanic $800 and I have to drive 4 hours to pick it up.

I can't let this stuff get me down, I need to keep my head up and find a job here so I'll be able to support myself.

With gas and everything I am completely broke. This is my first time on this sub - if someone would be so kind as to gift me a pizza it would totally brighten up my life. I will pass it forward when I become employed. Thanks so much!
