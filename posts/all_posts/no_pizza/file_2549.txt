I have been trying to make life happier for my children, since my wife went into rehab. They know that their mother is away, but I've had a hard time sitting them down and trying to explain where she is. When they ask I tell them that mommy was sick but she is getting better. Every pay day she would disappear for weeks at a time. I would drive around until I either found her somewhere, or she would come home with no money and "no clue" as to what happened with her paycheck. Supporting a household on my own was not something I was prepared for. I try to juggle my bills so that the most important bills get paid. I offered the power company half, but they would not accept it. I had to make a choice between getting food and having my kids stay in a home without power. We are down to 3 cans of tuna. We can eat on one pizza for today and tomorrow, as I get paid on Monday. I have a 5 year old and an 8 year old. Please help us.
