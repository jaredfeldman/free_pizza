I have the post-festival blues despite being accompanied by my boyfriend and a bunny fairy in a sexy tu-tu. Please fill the gaping void of sadness beneath my boobs with some glorious, glorious pizza so i may convince my boyfriend the bunny fairy is real and that we wasted (/not wasted) one of the wishes on pizza.
