**EDIT: NEVER MIND! Since we couldn't hang out, my girlfriend made me and delivered dinner! Here's my sob story anyway**

I never really did this before so I'm not sure how it works, and from the looks of how many people are posting and asking for pizza, I probably wont get any, but it's worth a go. My grandfather has been in the hospital for a week and my mom just went in this morning because she has pneumonia. My dad, who is still in the middle of work, just drove my sister to her soccer game and is going to visit my grandpa, then to visit my mom in a different hospital, then going back to work. He came home for a half hour and he said I can't leave the house because I have SATs tomorrow morning and no one can come over because no one is home. When he left he told me we have nothing to eat and to buy my own food tonight and he'll pay me back. I just checked my wallet and I remembered I just spend my only $20 to buy a prepaid card to buy a game on Steam last night and I'm kind of regretting that now. Now I'm stuck here alone for two hours until my sister gets a ride home from her soccer game and who knows when my dad will be home. No matter what time he gets home, I still wont be able to eat. So all I'm asking for is a small pizza for one so I can eat tonight.

TL;DR: Grandpa and my mom are in the hospital. My dad drove my sister to her soccer game then has to visit two different hospitals before going back to work. Home alone. Can't buy pizza because I bought a game last night with the last of my money.
