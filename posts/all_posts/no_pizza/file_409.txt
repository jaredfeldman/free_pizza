My sister's boyfriend bought me a $400 computer last week, and he took it home to put it together, install os, drivers, etc..

Well little did he know, ALL OF HIS ROOM MATES (except my sister, of course) WOULD JUST DIP OUT.

Now they're stuck splitting $1200 in rent, not including utilities, and they don't have any money for food. They literally have zero food in their home.

They would have plenty of money if he hadn't loaned me money for the computer..

I get paid in a few days, and I'm going to pay him back ASAP.

Reddit, I beg you. Help a brotha out.
