I hope I did everything right. My deal is no better or worse than most people here. I live in a decent place with a room mate, both jobless at the moment and going to school. Both on food stamps. I have a 2 1/2 year old daughter that most of my EBT goes to, which is fine. Problem is both of our cards are empty but mine gets refilled in a week. I have exactly one cup of noodles left, half a bag of pork rhines, a full jug of apple juice and possibly 3 sandwiches worth of bread for peanut butter and jelly. Honestly, we don't eat much. If one of you was so kind as to offer even one pizza, it would be very appreciated. I'll take a picture, thank you, anything. Thanks for considering.
