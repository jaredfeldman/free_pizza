From Miami, I know not too far, but had to come to Orlando for a certification course. Put hotel money and course money up front and will be reimbursed by my company either this week or next but all the expenses broke me and I left my emergency credit card at home. Anything would help and would definitely pay it forward in the coming weeks. Thanks!
