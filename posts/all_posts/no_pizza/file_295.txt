started a new job that's an hour+ away from me (after being unemployed for nearly 4 months). two weeks before my first check. about $6 in my bank account and everything else goes to gas and moving expenses so i don't have to drive so far for this job. maxing out credit card just paying for gas and rental deposit. bah.

i'm tired and hungry and just want a giant pizza and some soda.
