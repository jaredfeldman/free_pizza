Food stamps are now 2 weeks late due to moving counties and a new case worker that is slow as molasses in January. She's had my completed file for 2 full weeks (as of Friday) and still hasn't "processed" it. (Whatever that entails..) 

My family (Me, Hubby, and 2yr old baby girl) have been living off our pantry and freezer for 2+ weeks. Last night we used our last chicken breast. Today was literally buttered rice.

The food stamp office is closed till Monday morning at which point I will be calling my case worker, her supervisor, as well as her supervisor's supervisor; hourly, if necessary, until I have money to buy food for my family.

Until then anyone wanna send us a pizza?
