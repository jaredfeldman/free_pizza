I have cash in paypal but none in my bank account.  It takes three days for it to hit, and a couple of pies would bridge that lapse.

I need someone to swap me a $40 Domino's gift card for $40 in paypal cash and in return when the rest of my Paypal hits my account I'll offer a gift card here to someone who needs it.

It'll cost you nothing to help and gets someone else a gift card. :)

This is my first reddit post, I found RAOP while going through search results looking for pizza places that take Paypal (If only I lived in the UK I could do it directly).

To be clear I am happy to send the cash first if you're a regular here.  I very much understand this is out of the ordinary.
