I read about this website a while ago and had a little read through it, but never had the need to register. Anyway, the time has come for me to make a post.

I just moved into a small new flat with my Mum, after my brother died recently and she couldn't afford to keep paying the mortgage for our old house. Everything is pretty much still in boxes and all the cupboards are empty, so my Mum has been leaving me money or a sandwich from Tesco or something to keep me going. We had an argument last night because she was drunk and she promised she would stop drinking, and when I woke up this morning she hadn't left any money or food, so I have nothing to eat all day long. I have no money (the wallet was a figure of speech - I don't have a wallet!) at all, not even Â£1 to go and get something cheap from Tesco. I woke up early this morning due to being hungry.

I am embarrassed to post on here so I hope I haven't done this in vain, someone please help me out. Thank you in advance.

P.S. I'm in the UK
