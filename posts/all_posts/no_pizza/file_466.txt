I can't say that any of us go hungry, or are living in squalid conditions, but god damnit we get sick of rice and beans. 

We're located in Xer√©m, Duque de Caxias, RJ in Brazil. Our NGO works with orphans from poor communities, and also provides education and outreach services in many of those same communities. 

I don't even know if ordering a pizza internationally would be even remotely possible where we are, which is why it is a bit of a challenge.

ALSO! WE'RE HIRING!! The pay is shit, but this place is amazing. We have plenty of food to eat, and a roof over our heads. The team is fantastic, but completely overwhelmed with work. If you speak Spanish or Portuguese, and have an interest in this kind of work, we could have you down here in as soon as a month.
