So here I am, stuck at home on vacation. I have no money because student loans suck. All I have until Friday is ramen, eggs, and a pickle.  

I am hoping someone out there in internet-land will be kind and give me a hand. Thank you in advance

Edit: Forgot to mention I live In RI. And only have access to a Dominoes or a Papa Gino's.
