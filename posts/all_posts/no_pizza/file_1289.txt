Hi reddit, I'm new (but am enjoying this place so far!) so I hope this is still allowed. I'm an ex-Amish youth from a strict religious sect in Ohio who decided to leave during rumspringa. I have never had the chance to eat pizza or most other foods that are not home made until recently, but now I am in college and can do what I please. 

I am pretty money-less at the moment and would love to be able to eat a pizza, and share it with my roommate. I am in Michigan, in the USA. I can post pictures of my first pizza eating experience if someone decides to help. Or if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask me. Thank you reddit! 

Edit: Still no pizza :(! Welcoming questions, though!
