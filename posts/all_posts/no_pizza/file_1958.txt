Hey guys, I have never done this before so be nice to me! ;P

I'm in Pharmacy school in North Dakota (CST) and have three tests this week. I worked last week and weekend and again tomorrow and I am just tired. I have been surviving off of coffee ;P

It is getting about hungry time and I just feel too lazy to get up and make something vs. just order something. (I should be studying all of your renal transporters. ;X)The only downside of course is spending way more money ordering a pizza!

So, if anyone is interested, that would be awesome!
