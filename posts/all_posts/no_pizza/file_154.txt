I work as a fundraiser for a nonprofit, (thanks to some /gw posts made a while ago, I'd prefer not to say which), and our pay and our jobs are based on quotas. I'm on review, (meaning I have two days to get my average up, or I lose what is the best job I've ever had--I care so much about what I'm doing). Additionally, partly because it's been so cold here, my average has been down--which means, so is my pay. I have about $30 in the bank to last me the two weeks until next payday, but I don't even have access to it, as it's Sunday, and my atm card got stolen. I've been working all day for this non profit, (on my feet, outside), and I'm really hungry...I just ate my last two pieces of bread today. I'm applying for foodstamps tomorrow, but, obviously, that process takes a while. One pizza would give me two meals that I didn't have to wonder about. At this point, i'm just terrified of being overdrawn on my account again, bringin nothing to my boss's going away potluck tomorrow, and not being able to afford my $25 a week meds, (not having health insurance blows). The car I drive for my company is also breaking down, and a million other little things have gone wrong lately.
I have never asked anything of reddit, and I feel awful for typing out this sob story. I promise that as soon as my tax refund comes through or I get a decent paycheck, (about two weeks?), I will either pay you back or pay it forward to another redditor, whichever you prefer. My roommates are also in a bind right now, but have done there best to help me out when they could, so I'd love to be able to offer them a few slices as a thanks, and to ensure that they both eat, too. Again, I'm sorry for bitching, I know I have it pretty good compared to most of the rest of the world, (a hint to the poverty-related nonprofit I work for), but I could really use some hot food and, even more so, a kind act. Whether you can help or not, thank you for reading.
