**EDIT**: fark, I'm slow and forgot to post my location. I'm in Virginia.

First of, Happy Labor Day! I hope everyone has had an awesome day.

Like the post says, I simply lack the energy today to cook. I tried taking Effexor (an anti-depressant drug) and it didn't go well for me (lots of nausea and loss of appetite) so I decided to not take take it anymore. Of course, going off of an anti-depressant makes you kind of moody and that's where I am now. 

So, I'm here in hopes that someone will toss a pizza my way.


P.S.: if you need verification, I can send you a verification code as well as a picture of the pills/pill bottle.
