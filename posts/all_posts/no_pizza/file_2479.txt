UK. Just had a conversation with my introvert wife to set up which evenings she can be alone because she started a job with an open office plan and she has to be social all day. Turns out she needs more nights alone than she wants with me. I'm suppose to leave her alone MWF nights and either Saturday or Sunday until 1pm. And now I am extremely sad, want to eat my feelings, and I don't want to ask her for money to do so. Anyone up for enabling me tonight?
