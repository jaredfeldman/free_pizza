Hey guys i got into a car wreck month ago. I was driving though an intersection(My green light) when a speeding taxi who needed to get his fare to the airport at 6am in the morning.

I Span in the work van, im not sure how many times but the location of my work van showed that i had spun a 360 at least once. 

I haven't been able to work since due to my injury. I have filed a claim, and they have accepted it... I Just don't have that cheque yet and my bank account gets smaller everyday. 

Im just a 20y dude who is cravin some pizza with no means to the finish line.
