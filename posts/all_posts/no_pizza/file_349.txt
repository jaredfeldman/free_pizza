My best friend broke his ankle, and i would like to see if anyone out there cares to help me get him dinner, as he is using all of his cash on medical expenses, and He cannot work, due to not being able to stand. If needed, i can give a picture as proof. To anyone that reads this, this is NOT for me, and i would really appreciate the help :]

EDIT: North Texas. Sorry :]
