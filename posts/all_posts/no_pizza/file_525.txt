Long story short, today is my boyfriend's birthday and it has nooooot gone as planned at all. 

It sucks :( I want to take him out for dinner to try to fix this, but can't afford it. Broke as hell and I don't get paid until the end of the month.

I live in Canada, is anyone willing/able to help me out? Something delicious from Pizza 73 or Panago would go miles towards helping me perk him up and put a smile on his face.

Edit: scratch this request, guys. We're passing out now. 
Keep calm and pizza on!
