My husband is an ice cream man making 25% commission. I'm currently jobless waiting to hear back from a temp service. My husband works his ass off for free pretty much, because he cannot find a job not even through the three temp services in our area. When he first started this job he was making amazing money. But things slowed down extremely. He went from bringing home $100-$200 a night to $15 or less a day. He also has to pay for gas which is $15 a day. So as you can see he's not making money at all right now.
    The only reason why he is staying with this job, is because the owner is making him co-owner next year and also letting him stock vending machines so he'll be making two salaries. So my husband is trying to keep whats best for our future in mind. 
  However I'm in starvation mode, I've lost 4 pounds in one week due to not eating. I've been snacking around the pieces of moldy bread, hoping for my husband to have a good day and hoping I hear back from the temp service that is suppose to be contacting me back.. I just called my husband and he's only at $60 (he makes 25% of that, which will be used for gas ) and he's going to be heading back to the shop in 20 minutes. So it's another bad day. My stomach is killing me. It would mean everything if someone could help out.
     I'm posting from an alternative account because I communicate with far away friends and I don't really want people to know how much we're failing right now. I wont hesitate to give proof, My username, pictures of my cabinets and refrigerator, Facebook name, etc. I'm just extremely hungry, it feels like everything is just crashing down and it sucks.
