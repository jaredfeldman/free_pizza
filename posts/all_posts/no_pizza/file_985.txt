I have been sick since Tuesday and my fiance has been taking care of our son Tony(6) and baby girl (3 months). He has been taking care of their every need and making sure I got rest so I could get better. Our son was a big help also. When dad was making bottles, Tony would keep baby entertained. He helped dad whenever asked. I really appreciate my fiance and all he did this week to make sure everything was taken care of. I am feeling better, just have a sore throat and a slight headache. I haven't been able to cook for them and I know they would really love a pizza!
