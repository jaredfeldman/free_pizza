I have battled addiction all of my adult life - I have had long clean times (2 years), short ones, I've overdosed 4 times, and been to a lot of rehabs. I just returned home from yet another one and am starting over, have been going to meetings, have a sponsor, just got a job (though won't see any wages from it for weeks) and things are generally looking up. I won't lie - I'm certainly not in dire straits, but I sure could go for a pizza today.
