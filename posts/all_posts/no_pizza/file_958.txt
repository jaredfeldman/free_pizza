Hey. I recently had my hours cut back at work, and have been struggling to find a second job to make up for the lost wages. I've had to cut down on my food budget in order to pay my bills, and have been eating nothing but ramen for the past month. I only have a few left, and I'm now out of money until Friday. Would be amazing if I could actually eat a real meal for once. Thanks a lot.
