I've never done this before, but I am at the end of my education for nursing school and have had a bunch of fees for my NCLEX and license that I have had to scrounge for. I just worked night shift last night on a very busy floor (as a nursing assistant), have class in the morning and have had a serious pizza craving for the past 24 hours but no way to pay for it. I feel a little guilty asking, but I hope I can return the favor someday.
