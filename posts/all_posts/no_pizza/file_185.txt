Hey redditors! My 4 year old son had to have an anterior tibialis transfer to help correct his clubfoot.  The surgery went very well, and Shriner's ended up releasing him about three hours post surgery.  He's now regained his appetite and is requesting pizza. We'll make sure to post a "thank you" picture if we're gifted.
