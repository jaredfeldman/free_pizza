So, it's been pretty hard lately. My mom was laid off from her job as a teachers aid. There's canned stuff but we ate all the feasible stuff and now only have stuff like pureed carrots. The pizza wouldn't actually be for me, I'll survive, but I would really like something to brighten up my sisters day. My mother told her she didn't have to go to school today because she knew she may not be able to concentrate that much but my sister , who is 9 was like eff that and had cream corn for breakfast and went anyway. She is trying so hard not to be sad because she doesn't want to make my mom feel bad. She even offered to sell(pawn) her Nintendo DS to pay the water bill that came today. But my mom promised we wouldnt do that anymore...thanks to anyone who wants to help!
