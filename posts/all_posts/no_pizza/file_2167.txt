I'm a 3rd year illustration student in Swansea, UK and my dissertation (final 8k word essay) is due in just over a week! Have been stressing a lot about it and really don't fancy cooking for my boyfriend and I tonight (we'd only be having tuna sprouty jacket potatoes anyway as its all we've got until march 12th payday!) He also had most of his tool kit stolen yesterday (he's a mechanic) and its really getting him down.

can provide proof of sprouting potato-ownership, proof of half empty tool box, screenshots of half finished dissertation, photos of stressed me/pile of books and screenshots of $20 bank balance!

will pass pizza-love on as soon as I am paid, because we all know pizza runs the universe.
