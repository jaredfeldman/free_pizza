Hey guys, long time lurker who wishes she could contribute but never has the money. :( Hoping someone out there can ease the wait to get my school refund with a nice hot pizza. I'm in the Winter Park area of Orlando, any other details will be provided via private message. Thank you for those that read this, even if you do not contribute.
