Due to some error at work which was found too late for anything to be done about it, I won't be getting paid until mid January. Naturally as well as all the Christmas expenses, my car decided that this would be a good time to need repair work and everything else, so I'll be spending Christmas here with the dog.

I'm not going to be starving or anything as I do have food in the freezer, but I could really do with a pizza at the moment and it would be very much appreciated!
