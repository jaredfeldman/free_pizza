My friend thinks that RAoP is a farce, and either an attempt to gather addresses or send pranks. I just want to show him he's wrong. A large extra cheese/extra sauce pizza might change his tune. Afterwards, I might be able to convince him to pitch in to fulfill someone else's request...

I'm located in the Antelope Valley in California. I intend to provide pictures of said delicious pizza if it arrives.
