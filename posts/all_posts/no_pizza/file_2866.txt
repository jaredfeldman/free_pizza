StumbleUpon brought me to this: http://randomactsofpizza.com/info.html#started

and that was 4 hours ago. I've been mindlessly browsing this site for 4 whole hours. I don't even NEED StumbleUpon anymore. FOUR HOURS. I'm amazed, and thrilled. I got brave and tried to make a comment, when I realized I hadn't actually created an account yet.

Hopefully I'm doing this right. Just requesting for one. I can share with my kitter. I just need something greasy to console me. I might never leave here. Is there anything I should know in general about Reddit? Obviously, it's a really confusing place.
