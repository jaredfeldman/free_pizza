Rent is due tomorrow morning so I'm short on cash. All I have is some frozen chicken and rice but I'm about to begin working on a paper, a prelab, and study for a midterm. I just got back from football practice(I work for the team, UMD TERPS!)

I would love to have a pizza to get me through all this work I have to do.

THanks!
