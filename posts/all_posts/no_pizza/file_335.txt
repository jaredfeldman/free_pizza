I don't ask for any pizza I only ask for your vote in a local pizza poll.

My girlfriend is an Italian immigrant and thus her dad is also Italian. Her dad is the owner and founder of Ciro's New York Pizza in Centerville Virginia. I find the man honorable and look up to him and want to do something for him as a small thank you for his daughter being in my life.

Please if you have a minute of spare time, vote for Ciro's pizza [here](http://www.northernvirginiamag.com/pizza/). Help an immigrant build the American dream.

(if this post is too much a violation of the rules, I understand)
