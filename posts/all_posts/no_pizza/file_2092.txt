I have been eating ramen for a week, lost my job 3 weeks ago. Company I was at withheld my check, I had to borrow money from my roommates just to buy ramen. Would be more than happy to return the favor next week when my old job actually gives me my check. (Also, general location is Madison, Wisconsin)
