So here's the micro story: lost my job in Florida, moved back up near family in Wisconsin and into a motel, had to changed to an even cheaper motel so now living in Rockford, IL. I'm now away from family, no friends, and yesterday my car broke down. I am a freelance web developer, so thankfully I can do my work as long as I have internet. But finding work is another story. 

I have 89 cents to my name until who-knows-when. Unfortunately where I live, there are no places that deliver. Since my car's broken, I'm not sure I could even do pizza. I was thinking, if I could find the cash, I would walk to the nearest gas station and stock up on pasta-type stuff. 

So if anyone out there is willing to help, I would be so very much appreciative. If you have questions on anything, feel free to ask. I have verification as well. 

Thank you everyone for your consideration.
