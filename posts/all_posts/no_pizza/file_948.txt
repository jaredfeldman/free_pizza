I have been on /r/RandomActsofPizza, and I always liked the idea but I was too scared. Now I would like to try this for real, but I am starting off by requesting a pizza. I am a simple pepperoni type person, but I love trying new things.
 
This isn't a sob story of any kind, I just want a pizza. If you'd like, I am in the Orange County **~*area*.**

I would love to pay this forward to someone some time. The idea of RAoP is awesome; giving the present of ooey-gooey-pizza goodness is amazing. 

I hope to get a Redditor who expands my tastes! 

*P.S. I never had anchovies. I love all meats. Cheese? Please! Lots.*
