Hey, my bank account is over-drawn by $127. All I've got in my fridge is a half gallon of milk that expired 3 days ago, 2 bottles of woodchuck that I think are probably older than I am, and a slice of munster cheese. If there's anybody out there that would be in such a giving mood as to donate a pizza so I can have a good meal tonight and tomorrow it would be much appreciated. Merry Christmas to all of you here on RAoP.
