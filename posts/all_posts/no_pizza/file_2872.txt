Been pretty hungry lately, it's hard to find a job since I have no prior experience so I have no regular source of income. My college gives out refund checks but not until August 2nd. Could really go for a pizza or hell even just some breadsticks I don't really care. If you need any other reason, my 21st birthday is August 10th, and also I live in Ohio. That should be the biggest reason, this place blows. Any thing would be appreciated!
