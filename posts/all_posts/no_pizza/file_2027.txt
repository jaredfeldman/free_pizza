I only have 3 days until I'm done exams and I'm getting to the last of my food (will run out today) and money for the term(down to $10). I am hoping that one of my fellow redditors will add a little pizzazz to my diet with some pizza. I'm from Ontario Canada and go to the University of Waterloo and major in Math, so if you need any help there I can help you out in exchange.
