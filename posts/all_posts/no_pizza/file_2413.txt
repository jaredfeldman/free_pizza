Good evening Redditors! My friend Francois and I are hanging out this evening and we just decided to try reddit. We were looking around and found RAOP and we thought what a good night it would be if our first reddit experience was joined by pizza! So we are asking for a kind soul to hook us up! We are also willing to do something for you, udk what but we could make you a funny video or send you pics of our cute dogs and cat, or I manage a band, we could give you a shoutout on our FB page! Thank you very much!
