Hello there!
I just moved to a new city and unfortunately have not been able to find either a job or a place to live. My last bit of money was spent on gas this morning so I won't have anything to eat until the 10th of November when I finally receive my food stamps. A cheese pizza would be amazing right about now and much gladly appreciated ^_^! It's just myself and my little dog so at times things get discouraging when there's no one else around, this being one of those times.
