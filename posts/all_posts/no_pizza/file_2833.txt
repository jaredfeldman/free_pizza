**Boston, MA**

So. We have this fabulous Constitutional Law professor who had to reschedule a few of our classes for I'm not sure what reason... I think she was at a conference, or something.

Anyhow, this means that today our class is, at minimum, 3 hr and 15 minutes long... but she usually runs over time. Because the class is from 10.45 am until 2 pm (it's 11.45 as I post this), this means that we also will be missing all of the club-meeting opportunities for free lunch. 

Pizza would greatly be appreciated as we listen to Scalia arguments!!
