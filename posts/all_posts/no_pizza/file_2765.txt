Poor guy hasn't been able to shower taking care of our son who just started crawling like a maniac! I'm in Oregon and he's in Washington. He transferred the last of his money to me since I had to pay for my trip out of pocket with a reimbursement program. 

He's pizza-obsessed! I would love to order it for him, but his transfer won't go through til Monday so were both lacking, he deserves it more though. 

I will try and attach a photo of my crazy kid as well for good measure!!!
