So... this is finals week, and I figured a responsible way of bracing myself for exams would be......catching up on Futurama/Adventure Time/Fullmetal Alchemist episodes while EATING PIZZA !! Isn't it an awesome idea ? 
Also my battleplan involves a blanket and tea, and extreme denial of the imminence of exams ;) 

The only erm, slight problem I encountered in my GENIUS project. Is that I'm kinda broke, and fishfingers and cereals only last you so long before you are too broke to have pizza but too proud/ashamed to beg your family to send you enough to last the month :/ Anyone ever experienced this ?

So if anyone feels like sending a bit of cheesy food to Dublin, Ireland, it would really brighten up the whole *week* :D of a broke but happy female Economics and Politics college student. (not sure if there's a rule to specify stuff about myself to prove I'm real but, yeah, here ou go haha)

If infos are needed or something to prove I'm real PM me please, also I'm not sure how to give my adress or...(?) (sorry about the awkwardness, it's my first time creating a topic instead of just commenting. Stomach made me do it)

PS: Sorry for any second-language slips or grammatical atrocities. English isn't my native language. (France yaaay)
