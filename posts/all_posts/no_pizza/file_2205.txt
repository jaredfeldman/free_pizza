Is it true that people are just giving pizza away on this subreddit? I'm not quite sure if I'm supposed to tell a story about why I need pizza or what but unfortunately I don't have one and I'm not the kind of person to make one up.

I mean I am in college and as an RA I have been on duty all weekend forced to eat the tasteless cafeteria food if that's not worth a sweet greasy pizza I don't know what is.
