We just moved to the area, and as a result of putting down a huge deposit on our new home and getting in a recent accident, and my wife starting a new job that turned out to be the opposite of what she was told, we are broke and stressed. She just texted me and said she really would like some pizza and wine for dinner tonight just to relax her nerves, but we don't have enough right now to afford either. 

I really want to give her a break tonight, she does so much for us and she really deserves something to make her feel better after a long and stressful week. Thanks!

EDIT: We have a Pizza Hut nearby, so feel free to use a Pizza Hut ecard: https://pizzahut.cashstar.com/gift-card/buy/?ref=ph1
