Hey y'all. Just showed back up to campus last night, and completely forgot that the food court closes early on Friday nights. No real money to speak of until financial aid kicks in, and I could use food that isn't a vending machine bag of chips. Shoot, once I start getting my housing allowance I'll even return the favor. 

TL;DR:  I'm an idiotic sophomore sometimes.
