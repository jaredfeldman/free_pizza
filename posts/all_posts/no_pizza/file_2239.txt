I have tons of ramen noodles but I really don't feel like eating them and I don't have the money to actually order a Pizza (I have $30 until Thursday and my gas tank's on E) and I would just LOVE a dominos philly cheesesteak pizza like you wouldn't believe. 
Edit: I have a pounding headace right now probably because I haven't eaten all day lol
