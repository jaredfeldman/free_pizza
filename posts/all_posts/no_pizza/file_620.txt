Today is my birthday and I would love - more than anything - to have some pizza with my friends. I go to the University of Texas at Arlington. I don't really plan on doing much today aside from chilling and hanging out with my friends. I know that there are other people who are more deserving than me, but it's worth a shot to ask, right? Not really asking for much. Anything you can offer would be amazing. If not, at least go give someone else something! Thanks everyone!
