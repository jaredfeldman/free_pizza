To start things off, my birthday was March 7th. Last year i spent my birthday with my exgirlfriend. She brought me to a beach, then to a bar in seaside for food. We fought all day. This year i spent my whole birthday working in a sheet metal factory from 7-6pm. One friend smoked me up, then the rest of the night i spent smoking up all of my other "friends." My best friend didn't hit me up till 3am the next morning. 
Now that i'm done being a little girl, heres what really sucks. i got laid off at the factory two days later because my boss's twin daughters were hospitalized for something. Last week my car exploded on the parkway while on my way to secure a new job at a dispatch company working on ambulances. Water pump exploded, lighting my alternator on fire.  AND NOW. My droid 2 was stolen from me at a party last saturday. NOT TO MENTION THE BRAND NEW ITOUCH I GOT FOR MY BIRTHDAY FELL OUT OF MY HANDS WHILE FUMBLING WITH MY KEYS THE NIGHT I GOT IT. 
TL;DR broken itouch, got laid off, car broke, phone stolen, lost career opportunity could really use a pizza.
