Hello /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, how's your international coverage?

I'm home alone in Glasgow on a Friday night with nothing to look forward to for the next two weeks except sitting staring at my final year maths notes, hoping something starts to make sense before my exams kick in. I'm tired, stressed and frustrated, and could do with something to put a smile on my face :)
