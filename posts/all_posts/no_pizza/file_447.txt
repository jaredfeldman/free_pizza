I'm 33 years old and I've been unemployed for 18 months. Most of the new jobs in my hometown of Tullahoma, TN, are far beyond my reach of experience (i.e., medical jobs like registered nurses, etc.). I live with my parents and obviously times have been tough on all of us. My dad works a job he hates but has to stick with it so we can have money to live on;my mom is disabled and can't work. Most of the time we have to rely on local churches to help pay our bills and put gas in our car. While a pizza would definitely raise my spirits it would do the same for my parents. I hate seeing them suffer like this as I get turned down for new jobs. Needless to say times are becoming tougher for my family because the money is running out quickly. So please help me put a smile on my parents' faces for at least one day. That way they know someone out there is watching out for us. :)
