I live in The Sacramento Area in California. My husband decided now is the time to cheat which is wonderful as I am pregnant so I have been reading this and it has made me both cry and smile as people are so kind here.
I hate to ask but figure it is worth a try. Nothing to lose by taking the time to fill out a simple message, but I admit I am new to this. I have been lurking now for a year and finally broke down and made an account for advice.

So I will just put it out there, I am in the foothills so it is a half hour to get pizza but I will gladly make the drive if someone would help with the pie. I will be getting some financial help from my folks hopefully in the next few weeks and will pay it forward as soon as I can. If anyone can help me we have Round Table and Domino's or Mountain Mikes. I am not choosy :)
Thank you for any help. I do have a verification code if that is helpful.
