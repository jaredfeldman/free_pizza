Well, it's my first time on this subreddit, and I wish I was giving.

Unfortunately though I was able to pay off my rent, I don't have any money until Friday to buy groceries or anything similar.

It would really help me out if I could get some pizza to munch on while studying tonight.

Thanks if you can. Have a great upcoming Thankgiving everyone!
