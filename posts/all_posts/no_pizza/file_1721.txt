Hello there! I believe in keeping things simple and to the point to display the best of honesty so here it goes...I'm broke! Literally, I have 58 cents, which i will be using tomorrow to purchase a blue book for my final. I could use a meal for my empty stomach. Let me know if ya can help a student out. Peace!

EDIT: Whoops! I forgot to mention my location. I live in the state of Arkansas.
