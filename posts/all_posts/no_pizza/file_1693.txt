We are two 21 year old sisters on our own on the islands of Honolulu and we just spent what little money we could muster together to make this months rent. Things have been tight with money and we don't have anything to cook except for noodles. Not even butter :( Food has not entered our lives since yesterday morning, and it's now 8:00 pm. We would just really like a veggie pizza to enjoy with some Sprite maybe while we sit back and watch a movie. God bless
