So Here's the lowdown, I'm a 23 M fresh out of the army. April 17th 2013 and we are living with my wife's parents until we can get on our feet. I have been expecting my last paycheck for a while now but it seems long to come.
Both of her parents are in their 70's and living on retirement checks so i feel really bad about being here. But we have no where else to go. I will have money soon but not in time for it to help. (Pulling my Tsp, Retirement) and what not.
I have 1 boy 2 yrs and a pregnant wife and 2 older people, one on oxygen. I would love to be able to do something nice as a treat for them but i have no money.
Anything would be amazing, I'm not saying we Need it but i would rather not eat bean soup again and give us something nice to talk over.
You can call me and we can talk a bit, if you are willing to help, or even if not Just message me.
Thank you in advance anyone willing to help.
