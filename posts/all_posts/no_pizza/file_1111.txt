[A post I made last week.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ij98l/offer_who_needs_a_pizza_and_why_payingitforward/c2475o2)

I still haven't got my new credit card and I'm running out of food. It's a prepaid card through my work so I can't access my funds from a local branch office.

Any help would be appreciated, and of course, the favor will be paid forward in the future.
