My boyfriend and I are both college students who survive on financial aid. We have very little money to spend, and don't have the ability to eat out often. Though we are not in desperate need, a pizza would be a wonderful gift to brighten our spirits (and a nice change from pre-packaged food). It's hard to have your nose on the grindstone all of the time and not be able to go out for food or fun, but if there are people who need it more, please, help them!
