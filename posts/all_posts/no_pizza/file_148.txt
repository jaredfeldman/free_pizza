My little man was sick last night and we both got little to no sleep. His fever is finally breaking and his appetite is coming back. I asked him what he wanted to eat and he said either pizza or Pogo's (corn dogs on a stick), neither of which are in my freezer. I am exhausted and if I didn't have to cook it'd be amazing, but I don't have the money to order out.
