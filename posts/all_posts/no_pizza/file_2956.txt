My husband was laid off 2 months ago, the money finally ran out, even after eating one meal a day. We have a beautiful son born on July 30, WIC covers his formula but mommy and daddy can't eat until daddy gets a new job, and no one is calling either of us back for interviews. Got a letter today that SSI has reduced my payments to 0.00, even though we're broke, and now we can't make rent tomorrow. We could really use a good last meal in our home, I know this is my first post, but I saw this site on the news a while back and never felt like i deserved it as much as some of these other people, but then again I never thought we'd end up at the point we are now. I can provide more details if you don't believe me, but I would be eternal grateful to whoever would be willing to grant us this wish. Bless you.
