Hello nice folks!  I just got back from a two week tour starting from Minnesota.  We hit up like 11 states down south within that time period.  Needless to say, Im flat broke and pretty hungry!  Also, there was a complete lack of pizza during the tour, which is absolutely insane.  Thats what being in a band with vegans gets ya!  Now I crave it, and I have no moneys to spend.
