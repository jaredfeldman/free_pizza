I had to move out of my home last week, I'm staying at my office until I can get back on my feet. (Throwaway because my boss is a Redditor and he doesn't know I'm staying here.)

My bank account has ran dry due to catching up on bills. I don't get paid until Saturday. I will pay it forward once I get paid, and I will even use my main account to do it!

Anything will help.
