I'm a college student with a midterm worth 30% of my grade tomorrow morning as well as two papers due. It looks like I'll be spending the whole night in the library working, and I could really go for some pizza. I am located in Wisconsin (USA) and Papa Johns is located on campus. If anyone would be willing to donate a pizza, I'd really appreciate it!
