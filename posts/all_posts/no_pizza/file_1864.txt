There is a total of six people living in our small apartment. There isn't a much income coming in because it's extremely hard to find jobs out where I am. I've been doing odd jobs for the past six months or so just trying to scrape together money to help my grandma pay for our rent.  
I only eat a couple times a week because there isn't enough food to go around.  
If someone sends us a pizza, it would hold us over for about a week. It would be greatly appreciated.  
**EDIT:** I live in Youngstown, OH.  
**I will draw and send you a picture of anything you want as payment.**
