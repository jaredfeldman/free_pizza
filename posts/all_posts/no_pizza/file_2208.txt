You know that quote from Pulp Fiction about pride? It only hurts, it never helps. I've been learning that lesson this last few months.

Our household's budget is very, very tight. Basically, even though I have a full time job, I can barely make all the payments on a pile of medical debt. (A recent tooth removal pushed us over the edge.)

Well, if there's someone that could help us out, it'd be greatly appreciated. Cheers!

Update: Received a gift card from Gadianton. Thank you. You have done a great thing.
