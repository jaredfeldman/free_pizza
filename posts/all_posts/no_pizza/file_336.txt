I've never been this happy in years. Yesterday, I finally made it to school for the first time in 2 years. I have social phobia and depression and I would never even step foot outside my apartment, even to walk my dog. After years of therapy and medication, I somehow managed to gather up my courage and start a new life for myself. 
    I would love to celebrate with a pizza! I really wish I could provide proof, but I'm not sure how I can prove this kind of stuff. I can say, however that I live in NY.
    Thank you all so much for even reading this, I really appreciate it.  Much love &lt;3
