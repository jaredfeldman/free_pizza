...but I'm a dirty bum with no money, so I can't get one for her.

[Here's a picture of me with my swollen face and antibiotics,](http://i.imgur.com/cfGHG.jpg) as proof that I'm actually unwell. I guess I can't prove that she's been helping me out, but... yeah, she's been a saint. She stayed up til 3am and missed her morning class to take me to the hospital.

I'm in Canada, so I don't know if that complicates things, but... hey, it's worth a shot. Thanks for your time.
