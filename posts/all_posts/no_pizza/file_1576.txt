I've known about this subreddit for about a week, but I've been kind of reluctant to request because I see people who have either had really good or really bad things happen to them, and I would feel bad if I got a pizza they didn't. I still don't have anything really good or really bad happening to me, I'd just like a pizza and can't afford one, as well as I've got a lot of school work to do this evening. I worked through lunch (I just forgot) and for dinner they only had chicken (I worked at a chicken factory, so it's kind of difficult for me to eat chicken and not feel at least a little queasy), I ate a couple bowls of cereal but I think I'm going to be up pretty late as I'm also studying for a polisci exam on Tuesday, and I am already getting the rumbles, if someone could help me out this evening, I would truly appreciate it and be more than willing to pay it forward.
