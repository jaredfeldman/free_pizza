I've been debating whether to post here or not, because I am just beyond shocked. My boss called this morning and said they company had to let me go. He said they had to let several people go and because I was newer I guess I would be one of the first to go. I just started a month ago and had been looking for work for 4 months. I don't know what to tell the wife as I've been at the computer most of the day trying to take my mind off of it while looking for work. I'm hoping she will take the news as best as she can over a good meal. We're not without food, but I know that she loves pepperoni and mushroom pizza. 

What's left in the bank and what's coming in the next check will all go to bills, so I really have no way of treating her to her favorite. I've worked hard to provide for my family, but I feel like less of a man when I can't. I'm hoping someone can help me treat my wife to her favorite and that she will handle the situation well. Thank you for reading and understanding.
