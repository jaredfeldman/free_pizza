Things are very tight for me, and have been for a long time. But that's going to change soon :) as I'll be moving into a fantastic house in the heart of the city, with two lovely friends. My expenses will be halved, and I'll be closer to everything that's hapening :D 

I keep feeling this mix of anticipatory excitement and nauseating terror - it's clear that this is kind of a moment, like I'm closing a chapter on one part of my life and starting the next one. And I wanna celebrate with pizza, not with ramen or easy mac, which is all I'll have til payday on Friday.

So really, I just want a greasy carb bomb to the gut, to properly honor this moment! Thanks :)
