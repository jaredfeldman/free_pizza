Trying to get a job. I've been submitting resumes and going to job fairs. I'm so close to getting one however I am broke and have nothing to eat. My dog ran out of food so she's going on a little "fast" too. It would be a blessing if someone lent a helping hand of pizza. Also I am an artist and would love to sketch up something if you help out.( or whatever you want me to sketch)
