Hey Reddit,

A really good friend of mine is currently running out of money waiting for the end of the semester at her college in Wilmington, DE. She's running low on food and money, and is feeling down since a lot of her friends have moved out for the semester. A pizza for her would be really, really awesome. Thanks
