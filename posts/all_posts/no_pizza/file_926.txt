So here's my story, I just applied to transfer for other schools because I can't afford my current one so I just dropped 270+ dollars on applications, I am also currently taking an EMT course that up until now I thought was completely paid for and just found out I have to pay for the simulation test, on top of the National Registry test and also get my Ambulatory License before I can even apply for a job. This all adds up to another 300+ dollars and I just had to pay rent which was another 450+ dollars. I have no food in my apartment except for 6 bags of popcorn and a gallon of water, and I have 20 dollars left in the banks. I don't have an official job but work in landscaping making money on the side whenever they have room for one more worker. My parents help but they can't help much and I don't want to worry them with this. A pizza would help me a lot, that would at least secure me for 3 more days just to keep the hunger away, especially during my finals week where concentration is a necessity. So please help, I have requested before when someone posts an offer but right now I am really really desperate so please help.


I'm in California, specifically San Diego.
