Hi, typical broke college kids here. Boyfriend and I have been really struggling the past week and after catching up on the bills for this month have little under $1 in our bank account.. We were hoping for a random act of pizza to hold us over until my check clears tomorrow so we can actually get groceries. Really appreciate any help!!
