I just joined this site after hearing about it on the radio, and I love random acts of kindness (especially when food is involved) and was hoping to get into the circle. When I'm back home, I'm very happy to give a pizza to someone, but right now I'm not in the situation to do that.

We drove all the way from Washington, DC to Portland, OR and are heading to Seattle, WA soon. We're living off of chips and water. A warm pizza would be...awesome. Very awesome. If someone could help, I'd be super happy to have some real food after a week of nothing. Neither of us have any money to really buy more food.
