I'm not really sure how this works. What I need to tell you and such. I went out of the country last year, spent all my money, moved back into my old house with my roommate. But ever since I've had the hardest time getting back on top of my money. I had 2 jobs, but I decided recently to quit one and just move back in with my parents. I've got about 2 weeks left in this house, me and my friend who also doesn't have anywhere to stay live in this room. So now all my money goes towards paying off past due bills and people I owe money too, all Ive got in the kitchen its canned soup and fruit. Which is food, but its almost worse than eating ramen everyday, like a awful liquid diet. 
But whatever, I'm not gonna complain. I thought I'd see if theres anyone who'd like to share a pizza with me and my roommate sometime? Where located in Memphis. I suppose you PM me for the rest of the details.
