Hi Reddit, my name is jess and i live in dexter, mo. I am new to the site, I was actually referred to this website so I could find some help. I am a mother of two who has been recently laid off so I decided to go to college. Recently my youngest has been having health problems and I wrecked my car. I've never had financial problems before and everything has happened so fast I haven't known what to do. I've got bills stacking up, insufficient funds letters from the bank, disconnect notices left in my door, and thoughts that keep me up all night. Not to mention the constant pain I got from the injuries I sustained in the accident. I've never had to ask for help before, but then again I've never had to worry about how I was going keep food on the table and lights on, its really a terrible feeling. I'm not sure if anyone here will be able to help me or direct me to help  but either way I'm glad I could get all of this out. Thank you.
