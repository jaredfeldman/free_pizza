Long story short my husband and I both worked at the same company driving medical supplies to and from hospitals. We were required to use our own vehicles because the company only had so many (that were breaking down anyway).  The transmission went in my husbands car and our boss told him that he refuses to pay for the gas to run the stuff in a van instead of his car that he can't afford to get fixed and fired him.  We were in a tight spot in the first place because we're constantly spending our money on fixing the cars (that we still owe $10k on) + necessities. We have an infant, 9yr old, 11yr old and a pet dog. Ever since he lost his job we've been eating nothing but cheap things (hamburger helper, ramen, hot dogs) for at least a month.  We were accepted for food stamps but with my income they only give us $150 per month which lasts us a week with the amount of food my boys consume. My husband has had interview after interview with no luck whatsoever. I think they'd be really happy to come home from the pool tonight and have a great feast of pizza. 

Tldr; We're broke and sick of the same dinner table scenery and would really like a couple pizzas tonight.

We were taken care of! Thanks so much to MamaGrr!
