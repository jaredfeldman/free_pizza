I just graduated and moved into a new place in southern Ontario (think London, St. Mary's and surrounding area).  I'm functionally broke for 4 weeks, and would love a pizza, since they keep well in the fridge and can stretch over a couple days.  

I have some games on Steam that I'm able to gift:
Half Life 2
Half Life 2: Episode One
Kings Bounty: The Legend
Puzzle Agent

I've also got some TF2 items (nothing great, I don't really play it) http://i.imgur.com/amW9K.png

If none of that interests you, I can also some man hours if you need a C++, C#, or Java developer for a tiny project.

I hope there's someone out there who would be interested!
