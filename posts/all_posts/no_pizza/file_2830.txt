I'm living with my ex boyfriend, as he works in a factory third shift and can't take care of the baby but wants to live with her. His brother lives with us because his mom is a dangerous person and has nowhere else to go. He got laid off five months ago, when our baby was born, and because his employer didn't do paperwork, we were only eligable for one month of food stamps. 

He went back to work not too long ago, and when our lease was up, we could barely afford a new apartment. I was also just diagnosed with depression, and my medicine is another thing we have to worry about. Our situation is very overwhelming to me, and I don't know how we're going to get through this. 

I wouldn't do this if I knew we would be okay, we have doctors appointments that are coming up, medicine to buy, food, rent, bills, tons of other things that are stressing us out, and when I found this, I could breathe a sigh of relief. Please help us have a night where we don't have to worry so much, and I can repay you in cute baby pictures. :)
