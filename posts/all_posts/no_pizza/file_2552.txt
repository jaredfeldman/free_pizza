Hey, RAoP. I'm a musician looking to have a little fun and get a little more experience with recording. I'm not personally requesting any food, but I'm rather offering my services for those of you out there that want a little more of an incentive to buy someone else a pizza (as if the real life karma isn't enough lol).

So here's the deal: I will write and record you a personalized (to your username) jingle/song (depends on if the creative juices are flowing) if you buy someone else a pizza!

This doesn't have to start and end right now. Let's make it a project! Buy someone requesting a pizza in this thread and I'll write you a song for it! If you want to know my capabilities, check out some of the stuff I've written and recorded at [www.jonmiklues.com](http://jonmiklues.com). If you want a song in a specific genre or style, let me know!

I'm looking forward to the challenge!
