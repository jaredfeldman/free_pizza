We're a group of 4 college students, who don't have enough money collectively to buy ourselves a pizza, so we thought we may leave it to the RAOP gods (or goddesses) to decide whether or not we're meant to have this pizza. We live in Central California, and would very much appreciate a delicious pizza!
