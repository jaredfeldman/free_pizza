Greetings!

My parents are in the process of moving into their new home after being homeless for about a month. There have been a lot of really frustrating and stressful developments over the past nine months leading to my parents moving into this new home. I've taken most of this week off of work to come and help with this transition.

Unfortunately, after I arrived I learned that they have delayed the actual move-in days because the previous owner was a "crazy cat lady" and the house still reeks of urine. (There are visible signs of spraying in some of the rooms.)

I have learned that over the weekend my mother spent most of her time shampooing, and re-shampooing all of the rooms. Today my father and I spent most of the day addressing  and then moving in the heavy furniture and furnishings. Hopefully if all went well with the previous cleanings, we'll be able to start moving the majority of items into the home. (Unless it is decided that the carpeting will need to be replaced first.)

Anyway, long story short, it would be fantastic if we could have pizza for dinner tomorrow (Tuesday) night. I'm not financially able to supply any food while I'm staying here, and I was hoping that maybe someone would be willing to help us out.

Thanks!
