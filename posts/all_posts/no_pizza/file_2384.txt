I spent all of my food money to pay the last of my hospital bills from a surgery I had several months ago (my colon was removed). Pay day is tomorrow, but I have nothing to eat tonight.

I was also threatened with losing my job today because I pointed out several labor law violations at work this morning, and a pizza would sure help me out/cheer me up.

Edit: I live in Berkeley, CA btw.
