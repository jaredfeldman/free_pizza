I saw Random Acts Of Pizza on ABC news, and I have been lurking all day reading about all of the wonderful things this reddit has done. I just signed up today to be apart of this, and sad to say the first thing i will be doing is requesting. I haven't ate anything but a bagel in the last 3 days, and my paycheck comes in on friday, I am so hungry so if anyone would please help me out i will be sure to buy a pizza for someone in need when my check comes in

thank you reddit for listening
