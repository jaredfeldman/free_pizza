For the past couple of weeks the college campus here has taken away a majority of money. This last week has been the worst as I contracted the usual bout of seasonal illness. Recently I had to fill in applications to stay in their dorms for this summer, and also this fall. This has come with the unfortunate circumstances of rules, vague descriptions, loopholes, and lots of spending. Turns out that if I only sent in one application for /both/ summer/fall at the time the summer applications were due, I would only have had to pay 40 dollars instead of 80. Loopholes! D:

I do believe someone else definitely needs a pizza more than I do, and while I am finally getting better, I would like a pick-me-up from this frantic week. There's about 2 dollars in my account right now, and this is not enough for a pizza.
