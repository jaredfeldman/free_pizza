I'm a college student in Seattle, WA that is looking for a job, but I'm running super low on funds right now. Papa John's has a buy one get one free today, and that could feed me until friday! I'm totally new on here, but would be so stoked if somebody could help out. If this does work, I will pay it forward, because I don't want the guilt of receiving two free pizzas without helping out somebody else when I can to give me indigestion. I don't think there's a Random Acts of Tums on here anyways.
