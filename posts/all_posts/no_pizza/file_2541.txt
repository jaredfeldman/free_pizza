My girlfriend and I just moved into a new apartment after being homeless for a week and half. Our cubbords are empty and the week + of homelessness drained both our bank accounts. To top things off, I've contracted a flu like sickness and can't help around the new place much just quite yet. Some warm food would be greatly appreciated.
