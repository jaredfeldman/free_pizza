Hey all, with mom overseas working as a translator for the military the fridge at our house maintains a steady rate of being... 20% full, so there's not really much of anything edible in my house outside of oatmeal and canned soup. I do really miss moms home cooking but shit, at this point, this far deep into the void that is Finals week, I'll take anything that has substance in order to keep me moving, haha.

Much love.
