Hey all, I have been a lurker for awhile now but decided to see if I could get a little help. My previous employer down-sized recently and fired many employees including me. I am a single mother with three children. I have no savings and have been able to support my childrens lives and my own from paycheck to paycheck. If anyone would be kind enough to help out with a gift card or anything, I would greatly appreciate it. It will help us more than you know.
