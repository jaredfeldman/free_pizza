I am recently unemployed and had to move back in with my parents. I'm incredibly appreciative of them allowing me to stay with them but I feel terribly guilty about the financial burden I am putting on their already thinly stretched wallets. 

I would be very grateful to anyone who could provide a meal that is not on my parents' dime. I am in the Iowa area and have a verification code and hope to find some way to repay anyone's kindness.
