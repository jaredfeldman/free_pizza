Hello Redditors, 
have you ever received something for free? Did you remember how good that felt, just because "hey, free stuff" ? Well, I hadn't had that feeling in a while and I just want to experience it. I know the power of the internet would blow my wife's mind and my daughter would think I'm a magician. Honestly, it's not about the money, I'll pay the pizza forward to another random redditor or back to yourself(today you, tomorrow me), it's just for science , to know if free pizza really does taste better.
