I have a buddy in Idaho that's fallen on hard times and is basically doing low level MMA fights to make ends meet. That being said, I'd like to hook him up with some pizza, but Domino's/Pizza Hut and Papa John's doesn't accept Canadian Credit Cards, anyone willing to help him out? 

Full disclosure, he's a DotA buddy, so I don't know him personally but I do know that his life is kinda shit.
