This is pretty embarrassing, but yes I broke my bed. I'm going to be sleeping on my mattress for a while and I have no idea as to when I can replace my bed. I also had to pay off an old medical bill, which left me with .22 cents in the bank. This is by far the most depressing day I've had in a very long time. I'm willing to show my bank balance and a copy of my receipt from the hospital. Please help turn my frown upside down.

I'm in Georgia.
