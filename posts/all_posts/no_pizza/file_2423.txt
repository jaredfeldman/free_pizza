I graduated in June from UCLA. I didn't have a job at the time but I had some money and I want to be a screenwriter so I need to live in L.A. So, I set out to find a job. Was not looking for a dream job, just something to pay the bills. Now, here I am three months later and, if a miracle doesn't happen in the next six days, I'm moving back in with my parents.
