My name is Alaina. I'm 6 months pregnant, and we need help. Our family is large and we're running out of food. We won't receive our food stamps for another week, and no one has any money to even attempt to buy food. We're hot, hungry, and would be extremely grateful if we could receive anything.

**EDIT:** I'm willing to prove my situation via photos with date stamps in a PM.
