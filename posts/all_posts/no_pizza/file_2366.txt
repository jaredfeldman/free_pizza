&gt; Primo's Pizza, a locally owned and teacher-friendly restaurant near the strike HQ delivering pizza, pasta and salads. Call Gus or Daisy at Primo’s Pizza at  (312) 243-1052 .  Primo’s is at 816 W Van Buren Street, Chicago. Open 11 am to 9 pm Monday through Friday.

My sister is a Chicago teacher, and she says they'll begin picketing, tomorrow, so sending deliveries to schools in striking districts will likely reach appreciative mouths, as well.

Anyway, I hope we can show at least a few teachers some love from all over.
