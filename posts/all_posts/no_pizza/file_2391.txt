As the title mentions. I'm broke and unemployed, haven't been able to find a job for about 4 months now due to my location in a small rural Nevada town. Jobs are scarce right now. I've been drooling over the selection on Pizza Hut for about an hour now. Stuffed Crust pizzas from Pizza Hut have always been my favorite. Anyone out there who could help me out? One small catch: I don't have a car so it would have to be delivered.
