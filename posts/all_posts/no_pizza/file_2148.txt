I've never done this, but I lost my job around February, right when I had to move to a more expensive place to live. I had to spend all of the money I had left on rent and I have been living on beans and rice for the last week and a pizza sounds really awesome!
I'm getting ready for finals and almost moving home to a job. I will repay my pizza as soon as I get more money!
