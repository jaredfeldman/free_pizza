Hello, I just heard of this site. My family is going through some rough times right now, there are 4 of us, my father, my 2 sisters, and myself. My oldest sister and I are out of work. My father was too, but he just found a job a week or so ago. My sister and I have been looking for jobs for a while, but we only have one car at the moment, so it's hard to find an employer who is willing to work with someone else's schedule. I have applied at all the places within walking distance to our house, but we live in a really small town, and all of our small-town businesses are suffering. We've been spending the past week packing, because we are in the process of losing our house. We do have food stamps, and they definitely help, but we're out until the end of this week and would really love a pizza. We live in Georgia, Eastern time zone. The pizza places nearby are Pizza Hut, Little Caesars, and Domino's.

This is my first time using this site, so if I do something I'm not supposed to, I won't be offended, please let me know!
