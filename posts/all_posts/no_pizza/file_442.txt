My team and I are working on a Thermal Systems Design project in the library. It's our senior year in Mechanical Engineering and the workload is really starting to pile on. We've been in here all day and haven't had a bite to eat yet. Some team pizzas would really boost team morale right about now so we can power through this project and get it done today! :D
