Hey all, I love the stories I read on this subreddit of all you generous people, so here I am throwing myself upon your generosity.

My bank balance is looking decidedly negative, after shelling out money this last week for both my sisters upcoming birthday and mother's day.

About the only food I have at the moment is pasta, which I can eat if necessary, but I really fancy some pizza.

I have both a Dominos and Pizza hut nearby.

Thank you for reading and may your day's be ever full of pizza.
