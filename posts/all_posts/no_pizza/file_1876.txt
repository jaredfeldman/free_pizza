Hey you guys, I just got accepted to Syracuse University and just moved in, however I realized that I'm absolutely broke and I won't have a roommate until next week. I'm starting a job on Monday, September 3rd and would appreciate it so much if someone can hold me over until then or as much as possible.

EDIT: Just took a picture with timestamp of my acceptance letter. Can PM if needed.
