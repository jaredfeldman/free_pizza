Hello! :)

My roommate is a 19-year old college student who has a beautiful baby girl (who was born while he was still in high school).  The mother is a year younger and takes care of her while he is at our apartment for university - but he heard today that his baby is sick and in the hospital.  He can't miss class, so he's stuck hours away from his baby in our apartment worried sick.

In addition, while riding on a bus to class, he took his keys out (it was about to storm) and put them in his hands to get into his car immediately after exiting the bus.  He left the bus, but apparently forgot his keys, and had to wait outside as it stormed for the bus to loop around (takes anywhere from 20 minutes to 45), then found out that the keys somehow made their way onto ANOTHER BUS, so he had to go back to campus, chase down the bus they were on, and finally get home.  All during a storm.

I'm broke for a few days until I get some money, and I'll definitely pay it forward down the line when I have some money to spend, but if someone could spare a few dollars and help get my roommate's week back on track, I'd love you forever.

EDIT: We live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana
