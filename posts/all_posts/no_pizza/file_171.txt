So a friend I haven't seen in a while to hang out with a few other people that came over tonight. This happened unexpectedly and, unfortunately, I couldn't plan ahead as he is broke and so are we. We only have a bag of broccoli in the freezer and without sounding totally pathetic I decided, as a last resort, to see if RAOP could possibly help out with this predicament. Once I get paid, I will absolutely pay it forward on here.
