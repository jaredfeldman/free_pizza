Hey Reddit! I'm an RA at one of the colleges in Burlington, VT. I have an event with my dorm tonight, and unfortunately I'm a little low on cash. My plan was to get some residents together, do some team building activities, and then play Apples to Apples to blow off some steam from midterms.

Sadly, I usually need some form of food to help lure these kids in to take part in my reindeer games. Since I'm low on money until payday on Friday, I was hoping one of you lovely people could spot me a pizza. It's a small dorm, and anything would help. I'm not sure how promising to repay a pizza works here, but I'll hit you back with some money to one of "the big three" whenever you need it :]

Help some hungry college kids out, please?
