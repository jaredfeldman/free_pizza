IN A NUTSHELL, MY WIFE was prescribed Vistaril for anxiety attacks. Due to extreme stress she suffered one yesterday and now she is resting. Because of extra hardships this month our fridge and cabinets are getting very empty and I am NOT the whiz in the kitchen that my wife is. I have fed my children peanut butter and jelly for two days and now we are out of bread, I would LOVE to treat them to a few pizzas, yet my wallet cannot afford it at this time... We saw a pizza hut commercial for the big box pizzas and my 6 year old begged me for a pizza. It broke my heart to tell her we didn't have the money for it... when my 4 year old piped up that we can just go to walmart and get some money ha ha! So here is my request, if there is anyone who can get us 2 big box pizzas (one sausage and one cheese) from Pizza hut in Harrison Arkansas.. (phone number is 870-743-3500) I can pickup from there no problem. I will recieve VA education benefits on the 6th and can pay it forward on that day. From the bottom of my heart and from the pit of my childrens stomachs (not having to suffer through my sad attempt at cooking a meal) THANKS to anyone who can help us!
