I've been wanting to choose a different color for my room. I don't think anything like this has been done here before (long term lurker) so hopefully I get some points for at least being original. Yes this is a request and yes I will paint my walls any one color that my generous offer-er requests. I'm **not** starving, trying to feed 10 people, telling a made up sob story, or crying over having ugly walls. Still with me? Ok. Lets have some fun with this!

I have linked some pictures below, so that you see what you have to work with. The walls are an off white/egg color (bleh). Have you ever gone to someone's house and thought "Wow, why did they pick this stupid color?" I am regretting my decision of selecting this color. Just placing one finger on the wall and that one spot is now 10x darker than the rest of the wall. Maybe I just have dirty fingers? :D

I hope I can satisfy someones curiosity or desire in just wanting to have some control or a say over someone else's living space. I'm not a good designer by any means. I still think a milk crate and a towel make a perfect chair. No wonder I'm single. 

Anyway, I want to thank you for reading my very long post. I hope you enjoy your Saturday and won't spend the day watching paint dry. Please pick a good color. Any color other than white/egg shell. Please and thank you :)
