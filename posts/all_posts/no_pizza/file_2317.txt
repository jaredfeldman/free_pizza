Hey guys, me and my friend Taylor are both in bed sick. I have a pretty shitty cold, and she has strep throat. We both have a plethora of finals to study for Our dining hall, not that we really want to eat there, starts serving food at 5 PM. We could really use a little bump. If you want any verification, let me know. I have a pile of used tissues right here if you want a picture of that. I would be willing to send gifts of drawings to anyone who sends a pizza.
