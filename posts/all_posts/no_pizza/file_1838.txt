So you can read my iama about the whole orphan thing. Basically i have nothing left, and its my last night staying at my friends house in turlock before i go back to palo alto, all ive been eating here is ramen, and i was hoping maybe reddit would be able to help me have one last good dinner, before i have to live in a shelter:).
