It'll be another couple of weeks until my boyfriend gets his paycheck from his new job, and my income isn't really able to support two people so we've eaten a lot of rice and ramen lately. I've been craving pizza so bad that I've finally gotten the nerve to ask you fine folks to help a girl out (which makes me feel slightly less guilty than asking my parents for $20). 

I will definitely pay you back, or pay it forward if you prefer (probably both) as soon as I am able.
