Playing Blacklight: Retribution, it's awesome. Today is my 20th birthday, which is also awesome. I don't have any awesome food though, just ramen  and cheap mac'n'cheese. It's tragic as I get paid TOMORROW! I just moved here to socal and none of my family knows my new address to send any possible cards. I've got $0.62 in my bank but I'm a registered caregiver for my mom so it's pretty relaxed here, her paycheck is rent, mine is everything else. Broke till tomorrow, would fancy a pizza pie.
