I just have no money at all to help them but they could really use an unexpected happy moment! We have rice and beans and will not starve,but the kids honestly hate the same meal again and again. I will have the oppurtunity to pass the pizza along in a couple weeks when things have grown more stable here. Not sure how exactly to verify as I have no camera but please feel free to message me!
