Hi raop. If you couldn't tell by the username, I am broke. I have about 50 dollars to my name to last me until August 30th. If you're wondering why this is a throwaway, it's because I have family who know my main username and I don't want them alarmed at my current situation.

I was recently let go from my primary job and have about 12 to 16 hours coming in from part time work when I can get it. On top of that shitty predicament my car sprung a leak in it's cooling system and until an acquaintance can get to my city to help me do repairs i'm reliant on bumming rides off of people to get to/from work.

Suffice it to say a little pizza would go a long way for me while I try to get back on my feet. [Here is the only thing I can think to provide as far as proof](http://i.imgur.com/trd9c.jpg). Not really sure if there is something I am supposed to do otherwise, I just found out this subreddit existed a few days ago.
