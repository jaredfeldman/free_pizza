So I'm in NYC from Boston and I tried to use my card to buy a train ticket so I can get to my friends apt. He won't be home until tomorrow. My card was denied and when I checked my account it turns out I'm in the red because loans and bills came through. I get payed Wednesday(direct deposit) but I'm just looking for a meal to survive tonight and tomorrow. I haven't eaten since lunch yesterday please help!

And in case anyone is wondering Times Square is lovely right now. Still amazed that I'm here. It's my first time!
