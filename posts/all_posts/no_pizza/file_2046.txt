Hey! So I just moved across the country for school. I had a job during the summer, but I just spent every last dime (and maxed out my credit cards) to pay rent/gas for the drive/utilities. I don't get my last paycheck until the 1st on Monday. I won't even have Internet/cable until I get loan disbursements in a month (phoneposting... sigh)

The only food I have available is a cup of butterscotch candies the complex gave me. I'd really appreciate any help I can get.
