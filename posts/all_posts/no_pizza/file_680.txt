Right now I am between jobs,My work decided to down size and fired a large group of people myself included.

Last week my six year old daughter began very ill she couldn't keep any of her food down,She wasn't able to talk was having breathing issues and had a fever of 102 so we took her to the hospital before she became worse. During our hospital visit we learned her tonsils were swollen and needed to be removed her throat was almost completely swollen shut, she also has a bad case of bronchitis. The hospital stay and surgery to get her tonsils removed so she could breath left us with a bill of $2736 money we don't have we are crushed we have discussed a payment plan but it will throw us off with monthly costs my wife hardly makes enough for all of our current bills.House wise we are either out of or almost out of house hold supplies and food items.

The kids and my wife would love a nice hot meal we are in walking distance to a Pizza Hut [they do take out only] a dinner deal box would be best. We have three children,my wife and myself.
