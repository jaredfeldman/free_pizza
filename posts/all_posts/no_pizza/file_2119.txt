Been in kind of a slump lately, really missing home (Maryland). Florida is particularly chilly tonight, and is really driving the homesickness further. Pizza would be great. I didn't just finish my finals, or break up with my girlfriend. I have some food in the fridge.. Pizza would just be really nice right now. But of course, there are plenty of hungry Redditors out there. Take care of those guys, and let me know if there's any pizza love left.

Thanks for being Reddit
