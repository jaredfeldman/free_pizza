Hi all...

I've hit one of those lows. I have $1.95 in the bank and I ran out of the spaghetti I was eating once a day a couple days ago. I spent 30 minutes looking around the house for loose change and managed to find enough to get some peanut butter which is remarkably filling and has kept me relatively satisfied since. But it's running out and before I start pawning things off I thought I'd try to look for my own personal Pizza Jesus. Thank you all for the awesomeness that is RAOP.

Needless to say I will contribute at my first financial opportunity.

edits: spelling. because that's still important.
