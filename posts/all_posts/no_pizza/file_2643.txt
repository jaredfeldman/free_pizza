I live with my mom, sister, uncle, aunt, and grandmother. Our water was cut off a couple days ago due to financial reasons. Plus, our family has no form of transportation and we live in rural North Carolina so there is basically no public transportation and we have a hard time getting to stores to get food. We have been living off ramen and sandwiches for a couple weeks now we all need some sort of break. Since I live somewhat far away from other Redditors so any type of egift card would be great. For some reason just about all of our utilities are cut off except for power and internet/phone. I'm sure that any type of help would be greatly appreciated. I'm not exactly sure how to verify my story because of limited resources but if you have an easy way to verify than say.
Thanks
