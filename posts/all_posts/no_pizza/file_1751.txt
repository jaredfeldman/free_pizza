I have about -$5 in my bank account and a beyond maxed out credit card that I can't even make payments toward. I just moved for a new job and am not getting nearly as many hours as I was told, so with my apartment bills, truck bills, gas to get to and from work, I really only have enough to live off rice, ramen, boxed mashed potatoes, etc. Broke college student is broke and needs a break. So if somebody could find it in them to buy a pizza, any pizza, any size, any toppings, whatever, I will be forever grateful.
