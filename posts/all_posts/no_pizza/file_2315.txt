My roommate and I are hopefully graduating next week on my birthday, currently doing an all-nighter but our grumbling tummys are interfering with our studying. Rent is due tomorrow so that means no funds :( However a pizza with pineapple tomato and canadian bacon from wise guys would most likely help us focus, and thus graduate. making our last four years worthwhile.
