I have friends who come over every Sunday for our weekly table top. We always order food or cook a meal for the group. None of us are needy, but I see a potential to get them involved with RAOP. 

If pizza shows up at our game with no knowledge of the players, it would be "magical" and would make them all aware of the RAOP. More importantly, they would now be inclined to participate. 

So, yeah. No one is needy/broke etc, I just wanted to start of a chain of action from our Table Top Adventurers. :)

**Edit: I have no idea how to clarify that this is no longer needed since the time past. I saw that the moderators don't want these things deleted so...**
