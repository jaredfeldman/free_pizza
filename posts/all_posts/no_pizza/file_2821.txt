I'm planning a surprise party for my bestie, and spent money on ordering things and prep, and forgot to budget (too focused on birthday!) for my eating. Oops! Having a pizza would be a wonderful way to unwind from my now-done planning, and I'll be able to pay it forward on Monday, because pizza is the best!
