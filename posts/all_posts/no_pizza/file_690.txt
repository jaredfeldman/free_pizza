I've been without a job since the middle of August, so I've been living off of what's been left of my savings account. I've been living off of bagels and yogurt for the past month or so, and I really want a pizza to liven things up (and it'll feed me both tonight and tomorrow, too). As a college student who doesn't have a meal plan, this would mean a lot to me.

I'll gladly pizza you (or someone else on this subreddit, if you want) at an equal value at a later date, once I get a job and my first paycheck. I'm hearing back from an interview later this week, so it could be pretty soon that I pizza you back.

Thank you for reading, and I'd love to be able to give to this subreddit once I have money.
