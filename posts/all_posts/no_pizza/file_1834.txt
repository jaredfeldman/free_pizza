It poured rain her this morning. Some asshole drove through a puddle and splashed me with water after cutting me off at a cross walk. My socks were wet all day at work (I knew I should've worn wool). Also, my barber wasn't open today.

It's not that this was the worst day ever. There were some good things that happened today and its stopped raining, but that bad morning really left a mark. I need some pizza.
