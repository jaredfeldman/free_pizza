Just finished up my summer finals! I took very difficult classes but I passed thanks to my lovely roommate. She helped me these past 6 weeks but know I want to thank her!! I don't have expendable money since I am a student so I am asking if someone could help me show her that I am thankful! I will try to return the favor as soon as I get a job!
