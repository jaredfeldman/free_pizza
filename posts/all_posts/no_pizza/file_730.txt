This morning for breakfast, I consumed essentially what was left of my actual food. I had some cheese, bacon, a hamburger bun, and a salad. Currently, I'm training for my new job and am finding it hard to focus without bringing lunch for my very full day. If I had a nice, hot, gooey pizza for dinner and lunch tomorrow, I'd be set. Pizza Hut has nice deals going on. Buy me a pizza and I will trade you a body/hygiene/cosmetic product from my future store (You can message me if you want to know what store that is, but it is a really awesome one). Thank you.
