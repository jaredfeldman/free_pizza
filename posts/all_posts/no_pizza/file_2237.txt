Recently among our other financial woes we lost our car to a colony of homeless people under the I10 bridge in New Orleans.  In addition to smashing almost all the glass and beating the sides with what we believe was a golf club, they also stole my SO's suits which were in the backseat.  While we noticed several of these fine citizens sporting some ill fitting business attire, we chose not to approach.  We found the backseat around 50 yards away, but decided to leave that behind as well since a couple of very friendly men were in the process of making it their fuck pad.  Everything that could physically be taken was, but they left us something in return!  They took a big poop in the trunk!  Alas we miss the Mitsubishi Lancer, and the only thing that could possibly dissipate our grief is a delicious hot pizza.  
Can provide pictures of car as well as pictures of our really cute dog.

Thank you to fordgawn for the delicious Bacon Pizza!!!!
