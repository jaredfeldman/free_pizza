I got called in on my first weekend off in forever because my coworker is an idiot, and claims I was supposed to be in today. It's fine because I need the money anyway... but I'd really like a pizza when I get home, so I don't need to worry about cooking so late, or getting to bed at a decent hour for classes tomorrow. Plus I just would like some pizza...and I promise to share some with my dog.
