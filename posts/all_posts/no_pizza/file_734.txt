I in no way actually expect anyone to be kind enough to do this for me, but I thought I'd give it a shot.

I'll provide some back story just so that I don't come off as a mooch.
Currently sitting at home alone for the weekend, family is over 3 hours away, and my girlfriend... (or whatever she is to me after the falling out we've had over the past 2 months) is headed out for the weekend to go camping with her bestfriend. We're working on our relationship and part of that involved me moving out on my own so I could focus on myself, find a job, and seek help for my severe depression, until I've made progress towards getting my shit together she's not willing to say we're in a relationship more serious than "seeing each other" Sounds harsh, but really it's just because she wants me to prove that I'm actually going to get my shit together.

Today is one of those days where I've slumped into a depressed state, not nearly as bad as some days, but I've made progress and will continue to strive for progress.
I guess my hope is that someone will be kind enough to make my day, so that when I've got my shit together I can do the same for someone that was once in my position.

Anyways before I turn this into a book with my rambling...
TL;DR- Broke, Lonely, Depressed, and really hungry (I've lost 15 lbs in the past 2 weeks... =( )
