Hi! I don't consider myself particularly destitute, but some delivery, be it pizza or whatever else, would certainly be appreciated tonight. Story and circumstance below.

---

I work at one of my school's IT help desks. It's our fall break, and I'm here alone from 2p-10p central. Normally, I'd get a lunch break, but as I'm the only one here (no supervisor, or anything), and I don't have a key, I can't leave the office.

Delivery is fine, but I'm running low on cash until payday. A tight spot to be in this week, but I'm usually OK. When I get off, there will be campus food I can get, so it's really a matter of making it til 10pm.

Anything else you'd like to know, please let me know. Thanks for even reading =)
