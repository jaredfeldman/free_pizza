Lost my job a month ago, 50 cents left in my account. Girlfriend had a tax return coming that she waited this long for and it turns out her student loan offset it so that sucks. I owe $160 in bills and have no idea how I'm going to pay my $600 rent. No luck on the job front after a month. And on top of that, I can't get unemployment because the company that let me go for *some* reason still says I'm employed there so I can't get unemployment benefits. So I'm wrestling with that, waiting for someone to return my call after I sent them all the termination paperwork I was given. Literally no food left in the house, it's gonna hurt like hell but I'm thinking of pawning my guitar tomorow to keep us afloat for a week or so. OH, and her car broke down. Today of all days. My girlfriend told me to try posting here, I'd asked once before but it didn't work out and this years been *roooough*. But it seems like everyone's on hard times so I understand if my story isn't sad enough. You don't even have to buy me a pizza, just tell me it'll all be okay.

EDIT: Should also mention, Girlfriend's employed in a cafe at a local college, but it's closed this month so she's temporarily out of work as well. She's overdrawn about 40 or so so she's in even worse shape than I am. What a day.
