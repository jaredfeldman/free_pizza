Hello! I'm new too reddit ( over a month thankfully) and found this wonderful subreddit! Last month, me and my boyfriend were living out of my car. We ended up living and sleeping there for a month. I had a job, but my hours were minimal and we could not afford rent. It was awful, just recently though we both got jobs and we are able to offers the tiniest little place. Unfortunetly, bill this month left us short on cash with empty cupboards. A cheese pizza, would make the world a little brighter for us! 

If you have any questions about our homelessness, feel free to ask!
