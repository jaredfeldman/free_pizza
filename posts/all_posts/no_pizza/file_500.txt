I found this subreddit from the front-page. Great to see it exists. I am a grad-student at Mizzou getting my M.B.A. and while money is tight I would never ask for food for that reason, I can afford a mouth-watering PB&amp;J. Instead I just wanted to share a pic of the newest member of my family that will hopefully not steal too much of the delicious mana some call Pizza! [My pup "Memphis"](http://i.imgur.com/ao70I.jpg). If his cuteness strikes you enough to send a pizza my way, so be it.... you're just another one of his victims.

And for all of you pizza lovers out there, I challenge you to find a better pizza than Pepperoni, Canadian bacon, artichoke hearts, pepper-jack cheese, red peppers, extra cheese, and extra sauce, on sour dour crust.... What's that? you think you can? tell me...
