Been battling substance abuse for sometime, having some of the usual ups and downs. Can't manage to stay clean longer then a few months. Considering heading back to rehab, which is really scary. Boyfriend dumped me two weeks ago, he's dating a girl I thought was my friend, and they apparently have been in love for quite awhile now. 

Working two jobs has got me drained...and I really don't want to cook tonight. 

Thanks for reading. =]

I live in the southern US.
