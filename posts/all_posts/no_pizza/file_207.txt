I'm not gonna lie, money is tight for just about everyone. My mother lost her second job a month or so ago. We've been fine but the fridge is usually close to empty. Except lately its filled with eggs. Literally three fucking cartons. I've been looking for a job for a while and finally got one. But I don't start work for about a month so I can't as of yet contribute to the household. So I beg of you Reddit, please send me pizza because as good as eggs are, I fear I may soon suffer a heart attack or turn into an egg myself.
