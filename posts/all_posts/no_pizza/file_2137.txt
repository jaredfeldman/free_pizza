My wallet was stolen this morning, it had my passport card, debit card, school ID, a couple of prescriptions, and all of my money. My checking account has $5 in it, so I really mean *all* of my money.

I'm really not in the mood to deal with this right now, and I don't know when my next paycheck's coming in the mail. (Should have been mailed on Thursday, but my employer's payroll office is notoriously unreliable)

I'm a college student living near Albany, NY, and would love any kind of assistance.
