I've been filming my first short film/documentary all week and I finally just hit editing stage. I got so wrapped up in filming that now I have to edit 60+ minutes of footage in around 10. I'm dedicated into making this as good as possible. 

Oh and the short documentary is about people's reaction to the word dick and their views on masculinity. If you guys are interested in seeing the finished product I will definitely post it up.
