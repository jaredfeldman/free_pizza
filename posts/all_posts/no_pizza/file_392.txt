I've been a long time lurker and did not want to post from my main username. Things have really hit the fan in more ways than one. My employer told me on Monday that this would be the last week the store would be operating. Even though this short notice is appreciated (I honestly thought I would show up for work one day and see a for sale sign on the building), she shorted my last two checks and has not corrected that yet. I'm not expecting my last check to include what she still owes me. I've done my best to juggle my bills and I had a real hard decision to make - Keep the lights on or buy groceries. I ended up paying the power and buying a case of ramen. After eating this for a few days, my stomach is literally screaming for anything else. 

I'm willing to provide a copy of my bills, my last checks (and what it SHOULD have been) as well as anything else that may be needed for verification. I am humbly requesting a pizza, please. I hope that someone out there can hook me up. Thank you for reading.
