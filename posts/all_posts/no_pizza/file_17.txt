I hope I'm doing this right. I waited before posting, because I thought I would have money for food tonight. I tried selling some textbooks on Craigslist, but the person who wanted to buy them never showed up. The money I was going to get from my textbooks was going to be used for food for the week. I am completely out of food and very hungry. One pizza would be enough to get me through tonight, and hopefully I'll be able to get these books sold tomorrow.
