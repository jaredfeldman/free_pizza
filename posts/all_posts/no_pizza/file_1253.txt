Hi everyone.

I'm currently between jobs and looking to give my girlfriend a little treat on her birthday, a day we both don't have the means to properly celebrate right now.  We've still got food in the pantry so we aren't going hungry, but I'd like to switch it up a little bit with some cheesy comfort food.  Any kind souls out there today?
