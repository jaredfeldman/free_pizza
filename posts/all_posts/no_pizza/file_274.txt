Yeah, my parents are both unemployed and we never ever can afford to actually buy a luxury like pizza. All we have are pantry items, like peas and some cereal. Nothing really good. Haven't had pizza in forever, and i havent eaten for awhile because my sister ate the last of the cereal and the rest of the food is diet food for my mom. All i have, is some little snacks, like grapes. I can draw a pretty picture for you, and put your name on it! (: i can video tape me doing some corny jokes/pickup lines. Willing to do close to anything, im sooo hungry. Im in santa fe springs, california.
