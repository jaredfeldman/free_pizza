Hey everyone! The title pretty much says it all....I'm totally craving a pizza and can't afford one right now :( If some generous, pizza loving Redditor would like to get me one to last until my payday, which is Saturday, I would really appreciate it.

I will pay it forward when I have the means. Thanks!
