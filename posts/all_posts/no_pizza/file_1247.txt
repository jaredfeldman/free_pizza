I have about 15.00 in Amazon payments credit and I don't feel like waiting for it to deposit into my account. I'm also craving some pizza...so, I was thinking I'd have some fun.

Whoever orders me a pizza tonight and sends me their address will get a random gift chosen by me shipped to their house. It won't be a junk item, I will try to get creative and thoughtful with it. I won't tell you what it is so you'll just have to wait and see when it arrives.

My inspiration was a cross between RAOP and RAOA!
