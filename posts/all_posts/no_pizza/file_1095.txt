My husband is the best husband, father, and friend I could possibly ask for.  In addition to his full time job, he also works a part time job so that we can make ends meet, but we hardly have anything left for anything extra.  For our anniversary today, we made each other gifts and I wanted to make him a nice dinner, but we recently had to drain our bank accounts to pay for an (unexpected) car repair. I would really like to do something extra nice for him.  Can someone please help me make this happen?
