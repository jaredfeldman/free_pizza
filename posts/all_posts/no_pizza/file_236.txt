I am a college student, but I have no home. I've been sleeping on couches and making it by on very little food. I finally have a job that can support my living for a few months, but I'm extremely broke and its very far away. I have a bus ticket, but I'm down to ten dollars and I just don't know how I'm going to eat until I get a paycheck.

Thank you for reading if you made it this far. I know it would be very easy to ignore this. But a random act of generosity could sustain me in body and soul for a few days longer.
