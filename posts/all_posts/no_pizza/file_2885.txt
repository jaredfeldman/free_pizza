So I just lost my job after four weeks for 'not meeting sales targets.' I had hardly any training, and the boss fired me knowing full well I have a mortgage and kittens to look after. My car has a STOP light showing (Peugeot 207, fucking French shit.) and I have no money in my bank. I'm at my wits end. Please, help me.

Throwaway account.
