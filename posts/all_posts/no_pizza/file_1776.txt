Trying to save up money to go to make-up school and its been 6months since I have eaten a pizza. If I keep to my strict saving I will be able to enter my school by January!! Would love to taste the lovely stuff again. If anyone would like to help a Londoner out I would be very grateful. If I make it in the make-up world I will give you a free make over :)
