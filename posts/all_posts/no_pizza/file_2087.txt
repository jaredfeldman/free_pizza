Wife &amp; I are splitting up for good, she has gone for the weekend to spend time with some of her family for a bit.  Using a throwaway because we haven't notified most of our friends &amp; family yet of our situation, and I know a few people know my primary reedit account.  It's an amicable split, but that doesn't make it instantly easy, either.

That all being said, it's not only rough emotionally, but selling a house is rough (especially with the nature of the economy and us not being at a point where we were expecting to sell).

I could probably spare the $10 for a small or medium pizza, but I'm *really* trying to save every penny to help with all the costs.  Plus, right now, a lot of things just feel like it sucks.  A little more right now since I'm in this house by myself.

If anyone thinks I'm a troll/scammer, I'd be happy to give you the name of my primary reddit name in private and verify through there and/or through the verification system.

FYI, I'm in the U.S., if that matters to anyone.

Thanks, guys and gals.
