TBH, I never knew this was here on Reddit, but imho only, that information came at the perfect time.. 2 years and 16 days ago I was hit from behind on my cycle at a Stop Sign. The ER doctor told me that if I had been wearing a helmet, the force of impact was so great, I would have been killed on the spot. (extra weight (avg 4-6 lbs.) of the helmet would have caused my neck to snap and kill me)

Joining Reddit was one of the many things suggest to me, to help re-train my brain and thought process. To everyone I have talked/debated with, let me take a second here and say Thank You. 

But back to the reason for the post, may I kindly ask for a pizza? As it has been a long road back to somewhat normal for me and thinking about someone I don't know, caring enough to say, Hey, let's send this guy a pizza just because, well, it is so damn cool. I'm not sure what happens next, but to the person if they decide to say hey I can do that, please know from the bottom of my heart, I am grateful for your kindness and will pay it forward as I get better and hopefully get back to work.
