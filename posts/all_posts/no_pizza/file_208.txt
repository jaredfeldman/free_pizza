Hello, I've been a longtime lurker on reddit and finally made an account a few weeks back.. since then my life has absolutely been turned upside down. 

After this semester [full time] at university I lost my job. I had barely paid off this semester via payment plan when I received the VOICEMAIL informing me I was no longer needed at work. 

The issues created by not having money for my bills and gas caused major problems with my parents, who had been letting me live at home this last semester on the condition I would finish my degree and sustain myself financially regarding everything but the roof over my head. Needless to say, they do not really have the means to support another person and I left because of this strain.

I have been couch crashing this last week at a friends' with literally nothing to offer him (or his awesome, understanding roommates who I really just met) in return for their hospitality. A PIZZA!! =) to share with these great people would not only be the first whole meal I have had for a while, but it would go a long way towards making me feel a bit better about myself for actually contributing to this house a bit. The other folks here are all struggling students, and looking in the pantry all I'm seeing is ramen and potatoes (lol). 

Thanks for putting up with this wall of text, I felt obligated to give the whole story! Not sure of what evidence is necessary but needless to say if you ask for it I will provide. I hope I did this right (got a confirmation code as well if needed) but here goes heh. Take care!
