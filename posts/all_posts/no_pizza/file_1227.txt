Due to problems with work not paying me correctly or on time, I've fallen in a situation where all of my funds had to go towards my rent. I get a paycheque tomorrow but have zero funds until then, and not gonna lie I'm a little hungry! Heard about this subreddit and thought I'd give asking for internet help a try, and would love to return the favour this week as well!
