If some generous soul is awesome enough to buy me a pizza tonight, I will either:

a) Buy someone else a pizza when I've got the cash (pay it forward and all)

**OR**

b) Play you a song. I play tuba! I can also play guitar/bass decently, nothing special though.   
*Disclaimer: I'm not a very good singer.*

Your choice!

I live in Southern CA.
