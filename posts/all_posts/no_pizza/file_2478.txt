Hi everyone...I have a job, and I go to school, but recently, I've found myself broke, with my car in the shop.  My checking account is in the negative and my fridge is pretty bare.  I would love a pizza today.  I figure I can make a few meals from it.  When I get my finances back on track I will pay it forward for someone else.  Thank you in advance and have a great day :)
