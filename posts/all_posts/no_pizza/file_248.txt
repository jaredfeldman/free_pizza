Ive been eating nothing but rice and when im lucky ramen for almost 4 months now since being laid off from my computer repair gig. I live in Alaska where the economy and culture is about 4-5 years delayed from the rest of the US so the recession is only now starting to really take hold here, as such Ive been unable to find any regular work even at any of the typical franchised fast food joints. BUT I can make music, so if there is any kind of song you have ever wanted to hear or have made for yourself, a loved one, a personal project, or perhaps a video or web-series of yours; tell me about it and I will make it happen for a pizza. Preferably a pizza with meat on it, I literally have dreams of meat and cheese these days. 

I can do electronic, hip-hop, blues, rock, doom metal, black metal, world/ethnic, orchestral pieces, 80s synth pop, ambient, almost anything really. If desired, I could sing a name, tagline, or slogan and do it jingle style or even use crazy robot voice effects. I could also mimic a specific artists style.

TLDR: Will music for food
