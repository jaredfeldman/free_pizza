Hey ROOP, I recently was "let go" from my job, after asking for a month and a half to be scheduled more than 6 hours every two weeks. I've been searching for a job for the duration of this slow, twisted screw-over, but have had no luck. I will receive *some* unemployment, but it will not come in for another two weeks, provided my last employer doesn't somehow convince the state to also screw me over. It's been an unusually rough patch in my life, and I'll spare you the details of everything else, but I'm 3,000 miles from my family and they're too broke with medical bills to help. 

Would anyone be so kind as to order me a pizza and feed me for a few days?

Much love,
Preston
