It's just been a shitty month. Been broke since I had to drive down to my sister's funeral. Was fired because it took me week of being stuck in MS with car toubles before I got back. Had to give my cat away because i can't afford to keep him. His name was Clegg and he was pretty much my best friend. And my real life best friend is moving away tomorrow. I hate giving a sob story, but i'm just really really down and hungry. please help. Thank you reddit.
