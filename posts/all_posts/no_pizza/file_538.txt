So where he works he somehow got free pizza for dinner and texted me I was on my own. I told him to bring me some and he said he can't...they ate it all. :(  I'm in Sherwood Arkansas and thought I might give this a try. Think it might make him laugh if I get a pizza too. :) 

EDIT: Ok cancel this request. A friend called me and if going to take me out to dinner. :)
