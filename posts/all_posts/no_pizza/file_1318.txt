Today my boyfriend and I have been together 7 years. It's been a rough, jobless summer, and although we are both back to work, we don't get paid until thursday. We have no money for food, or to celebrate our anniversary. A pizza would make us so happy!

The only place that has online ordering right now only accepts credit cards, so we know it might be a long shot, but hoping someone would be kind enough to help us out. :)
