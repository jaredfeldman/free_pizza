Haven't done this before, won't pull at your heartstrings. What I will say is that i haven't eaten anything since Friday, I have no food in and no money to buy any. If anyone feels like helping a brother out, it would be much appreciated. Will happily return the favour when student loans come in in a couple of weeks.
