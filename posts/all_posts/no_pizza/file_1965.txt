So yeah, new to this sub-reddit.. Jobless and alone for turkey day.. I don't even know if they are open on thanksgiving.. probably not right? Anyway, I'm in North Mankato, MN.. if anyone would like to help, I would really appreciate it, and hopefully in about a month, I'll be able to pay back, or even help out another reddit-or.. 

Thanks for reading, hope you all have a happy holiday, even if you don't celebrate :)
