... So I figured I'd give reddit a shot. I'm currently broke and unemployed, crashing on my buddy's couch. I've got 7 cents in my bank account and 10 cents on my EBT, which won't reload till 8/7. Technically I'm between jobs, waiting on an unpaid PA gig, but they're covering meals, travel, room &amp; board so it's not all bad. Anyway. Pizza, or no pizza, thanks for letting me vent :)
