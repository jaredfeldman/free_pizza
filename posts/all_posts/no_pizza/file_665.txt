Hello Reddit,
                 My family is small consisting of my son, my wife, and me. I was on unemployment for being laid off around a year ago but I stopped receiving it about two months now. Ive been looking for a job but since gas prices are so high money has been tight. My wife has been angry with me for not being able to find a job but I'm trying my best its just hard these days. A friend at church told me about this site so i figured id give it a try. If any one can help us out you would make my wife and son so happy. Thank you God bless.
