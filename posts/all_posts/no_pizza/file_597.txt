I am a longtime lurker and have made people into redditors
I plan on keeping this account as the name is exactly how I've feelt the past 4 years 
I have just finished an exam(A level's) and have spent all my money on a travelcard for the week (more exams on tuesday and thursday).
I live alone and do not get any money until friday(part time bar work).
All i have left to eat is 2 cans of tuna, I would be willing to sell my soul(I dont have anything else to sell) for food.
I would be willing to send proof (contract for soul,internet bank statement,two cans of tuna)
Somebody please help me.
I know its random acts of pizza but i wouldn't mind even if it was 4 grocery items (cheaper than a pizza in total)(2 more cans of tuna and sweetcorn and mayo)
