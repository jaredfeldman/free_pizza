Hi Everyone,

This is my first try at this.  We have a family of seven and are just running a little short this week until payday on Tuesday.  We would really appreciate a pizza or two tonight so that we can get off the Ramen binge this weekend.  If you'd like to help us out, please feel free to ask whatever questions you might have.  

Thanks,
Jason
