So. Was randomly 'asked to resign' or 'get terminated' from my job that I loved as an EMT. I think I'm about to get another job, but, it's been hard because I help provide for my elderly adoptive mother (she's 82). We're getting low on food, and today she just walked by me and said " I wish we had a pizza". I feel terrible because I can't afford such a luxury right now and she doesn't eat enough as it is, but it made me think of you guys over here! I'll provide whatever proof I can if you want it; Thanks guys &lt;3
