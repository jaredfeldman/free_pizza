My friend doesnt know Im doing this but she is on her last week in Hawaii and the guy she went there with is gone and shes spent all her money for moving expenses back to the mainland. I live in Florida but Im more broke than she is lol. Its her birthday and I was trying to find birthday freebies since she only has her cell for internet but wow... google maps shows no dice! She lives near the Battleship Missouri nearest I can tell lol. ( I never realized how big the island is!!). I am going to a meetup in an hour but will only be gone about 2 hrs. Its 530 here but 1130am there so there is time.
