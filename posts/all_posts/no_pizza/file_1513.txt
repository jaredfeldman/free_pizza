I just decided to take 21 credits this semester, which is an insane amount compared to the 12-15 I usually do.  I've been up since 5am doing the first two weeks of homework for as many of my classes as possible, which sadly has only been three.  I'm exhausted, and in the least self-entitled tone I can muster, I feel like I've earned a small pie.  

Woo!

Oh yeah, and location: Arizooona!
