Hi Reddit, I don't really like asking for help but my daughter and I just moved into our apartment a week ago and we are going through a bit of a rough patch [financially](http://i.imgur.com/9IH4v.jpg). At the moment we have [no food](http://imgur.com/a/UCUvL#0) except some condiments. My daughter is extremely hungry and words can not describe how low I feel about not being able to feed her. I really thought I planned things out well but I did not. And now she has to suffer for my screw up.

As I stated [I have Paypal cash](http://imgur.com/2AO2c), but I do not have a paypal debit card, If someone would want to do a trade I'd appreciate it. If anyone can help but does not have a Paypal I can send you a [$25 Bath and body works GC](http://imgur.com/a/UCUvL#0). It is my fault that I did not plan things correctly, and this is my last option for today to make things right for my daughter. I am not in any way shape or form asking for a handout or a freebie, I just want to make a simple trade so my daughter and I can eat tonight. I'm not posting on my real account because I'm ashamed that things turned out this way and I feel I should only be here to help and not to be helped. But I can do a trade and pay it forward to make it up. If you want any more proof please don't hesitate to ask, I can give my account name and more picture, even a picture of my state ID.
