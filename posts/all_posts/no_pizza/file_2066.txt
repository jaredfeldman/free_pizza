Canadian post-grad here, I don't really want to get into too much detail about myself suffice to say that I have bills racked up that I need to pay and no job to pay for them, increasingly falling into debt and I know it's crazy but I've been prioritizing paying down my student loans than feeding myself. I'm not sure how much longer I can go on like this, I've lost a lot of weight over the past few months and things just keep getting worse. If my father was still alive I'm sure I wouldn't need to ask for this help, but in the current financial state my mother is in I cannot ask her for help (she would help me, but then she would have nothing to eat, maybe even lose her house).

I feel disgusted with myself that it has come to this, my self esteem isn't usually this low but with everything the way it is, it's hard to feel good about myself.
