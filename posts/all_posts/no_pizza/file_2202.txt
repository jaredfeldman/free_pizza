A good three months ago, a family welcomed me into their home when I was living on the streets. I was homeless, broke and starving when they saved me. Now, I am on my feet thanks to them and they are moving tomorrow because of a family emergency. Since all of the food is packed up, I would like to get them a pizza but I do not have the money to do this until I get paid next Friday, which will be to late, so I will pay forward. Many thanks
