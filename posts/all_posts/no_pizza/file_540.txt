The roommate's out, the boyfriend's having a night with his friends.  I'm a week away from turning 22 with no job and no social life (which is good I guess, because I'd be enticed to eat out more).  My family pays me to clean houses for them, but that $100 I make goes straight into groceries (now eaten twice as fast since the bf decided to save money buying lunch at work by having me cook when he's over; I don't mind, but he hasn't contributed much to the grocery bill) and gas.  I'm feeling pretty down tonight, but I'm not the worst off.  I have food in my apartment, and a car that runs.  But I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask.
Anyone wanna float me a slice?  I'll draw just about anything you want.  I can do some half-decent portraits, manga was my old hobby, I can make some MLP characters... :P  All by hand, colored, for you.  Or I can send you pics of my roommate's cat and my cat. 
Thanks for reading! &lt;3
