Hi, thanks for reading. My husband and I just have had to close our company down due to the economy and to be honest we are barely making it by on Public Assistance for the first time ever. We have 4 great kids who have made the best out of a kind of bummer summer and we would love to surprise them with Pizza and a movie. It would be great as the summer is coming to an end and would love a night of smiles. Thanks again for reading.
