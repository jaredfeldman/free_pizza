Let me get this straight, I HATE asking for handouts. I hate it. But Im really really sick today, and I don't have anything to eat. If I ended up getting a pizza out of this I swear to god I'd be so happy.

This is also my first time doing this, I don't exactly feel comfortable putting my address in this, but my general area is as follows:

Ottawa, Canada

Orleans,

Chapel Hill

If you're familiar with that suburb, and are feeling generous, message me :)
