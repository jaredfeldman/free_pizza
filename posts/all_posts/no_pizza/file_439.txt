I just had the best night I've ever had in years. I've finally come out of my shell, opened up, and won over the most beautiful girl I've had the opportunity to have my arm around. I cannot express exactly how I'm feeling. I haven't stopped smiling, and my hearts still racing. I'm taking the chance to be close with someone again. And I figured I'd take the chance on a free pizza to enjoy while I feverishly tell my best friend what happened over Xbox live states away. 

Oh, and if your a halo 4 fan.
