Eglin AFB, Fl.

My husband and I live on a military base. We don't get paid until in the am of tomorrow and we are down to no food and 47 cents in our checking. We are so broke because of me. I have illnesses that require medication that our insurance doesn't cover, as they only cover generic. This man has given everything to me and wants to take care of me. I wish I could do the same for him. So please, we need our faith in strangers restored. We will do the same. Please.
