I went out with some friends earlier in the week and ended up lending my friend 20 bucks til he could get to an ATM. Long story short, we ended up pretty silly drunk and crashed at different houses so he never got a chance to pay me back.

I get paid tomorrow and I could definitely tough it out, but I'd love to down a few slices before I spend the night cleaning up my apartment.
