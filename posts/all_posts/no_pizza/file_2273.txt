Well, i don't have a life threatening disease, i'm not poor, i'm not anti-social and have friends... I mean, there's nothing that makes me stand out to want a pizza more than others. I just want pizza because it's fucking delicious. 

I go to school at Ohio University and i just want pizza. Any acts of Pizzaness will be returned to another redditor.
