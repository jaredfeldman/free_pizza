Hello, let me give you the story. I was kicked out on sunday and spent two days with a friend. My girlfriend was coming in from canada to stay at a hotel room which was supposed to be booked at $280 dollars. When she got here, the hotel came out to 460$. The extra money came out from our food fund, and we had about $20 for food and it ran out. We have been eating the little bit of snacks we have and its starting to make us sick. If you could spare a pizza please do. &lt;3
