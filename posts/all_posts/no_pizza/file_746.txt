guys, I have been living off of pbj for 2 days, due to a problem with the direct deposit money transfer that has left 2 dollars in my bank account as they sort it out.. I couldn't help but notice the influx of Papa John's coupons, but only have a dominos close to me :( can some kind redditor please help me out? I can make a promise to pay it forward and return the favor once the money situation is settled. Thank you for your kindness.
