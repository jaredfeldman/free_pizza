My parents just went through a divorce and times have been hard on both my mom and dad. I'm living with my mom now but may have to move to my dads because my mom isn't able to support me and my dad isn't paying child support to my mom. i would love to treat myself to a pizza but i have nearly any money to pay for one, please help me with paying for a pizza! i will return the favor once i am able to!
