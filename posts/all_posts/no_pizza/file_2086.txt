Hello,

Yesterday I went to get groceries and I switch to small bag purse. Now my wallet is in the small bag purse. In my wallet it has my ID so I can't get money at a bank. Today is payday and I do have money but no access to it.I am too afraid to ask my coworkers to borrow money as I am a student worker so my coworkers are all my supervisors.  I work at 8am everyday and I skip breakfast. I don't want to be greedy and get a whole pizza so that is why I am asking for a sandwich.

You can check my account, I have send strangers random cards to try to pay it forward.

EDIT: I didn't get anything but that is okay. I get off work in a hour and I can go home and finally eat something.
