I posted in the other subreddit but though I'd try here too. 

Hi reddit. This is my first time ever doing something like this but here I go.

I am requesting a pizza to feed two adults in Westminster MD. My fiancé and i are behind because I broke my ankle in July and have been out of work since because the break required extensive surgery. All pizza chains are equally distant and would require us to pick up.

My fiancé doesn't get paid until next Friday and his parents can only help so much, mostly with money for utilities and prescriptions for both of us. We have maybe $20 to our name and he has a full work schedule next week as well as having to take me to a follow up appointment with my surgeon on Monday, who is located a thirty minute drive away.

We've been eating a lot of PBJs and ramen and our ramen is running out so a pizza could really help out a lot. When we have gotten two pizzas in the past,they have lasted us for three-four days.

Thanks for your consideration and time reading this.

ETA : I do have a verification code for this sub. :)
