Hey everybody,

I stumbled into this subreddit yesterday, and the kindness and generosity that is flowing through here absolutely warms my heart.  I don't have a sob story or a starving family to feed, just a kid putting himself through college, so I'm saving every penny I scrape together.

If someone saw it in their heart to help a complete stranger out, I would be incredibly appreciative.
