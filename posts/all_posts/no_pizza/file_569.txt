I've been emotionally rocky the last few days.  Being around people has been very upsetting to me the last few days, I just got off work about an hour and a half ago and had to immediately find a quiet spot outside to break down for half an hour.  I'm sure this is just stress, I moved/graduated/got a new job recently and don't have any close friends in my new area yet (besides a college friend who thankfully moved to this area too).

I'm taking the night off to stay in and heal.  It would be awesome to be able to nibble on a pizza while doing so.  Promise I'll pay it forward in the near future.
