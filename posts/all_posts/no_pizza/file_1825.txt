Hello, everyone! I'm new to this website. I was chatting with someone on a different website about how it totally sucks when you're really hungry and someone calls you up telling you all about the awesome food they just made. It ended up turning into a talk about how I've only got enough food in the house for my little one to eat until Saturday (which is when my food stamps refresh). So they linked me here! I didn't even know that something like this existed, it is amazing~

I've got to work tonight at 5, but my place of employment is right next to a Dominos, so carry out would be the best option, if anyone is feeling generous today. I'd really appreciate it!

Thanks for reading!
