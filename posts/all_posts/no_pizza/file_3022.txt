We ate lunch yesterday around noon, then proceeded to get crazy hammered and have zero food (literally. I checked) in the house. We're also out of money on account of paying for gas to drive some girls home this morning. Fact is, we're starving. I remembered hearing about this place awhile back and thinking, "DisplacedLeprechaun, one day you'll be hungry as hell. Try that subreddit and see if it can help."

So here I am. And if it works, come this Friday on my payday I'll be giving a pizza to someone on here. Fair is fair.

Cheers!
