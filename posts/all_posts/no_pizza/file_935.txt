First time requester here. I know it's pretty cheesy but I really love this girl, I want her to remember that I'll never stop caring. Recently, her car has been totaled so I haven't really been seeing her much like I used to. It's been about two months so far and every week I come by on the bus to see her and spend a couple days with her. She lives about 30 miles away so It's a definite I need to bus it trip. This week I managed to find her a ride here for our six months together and she's excited cause I planned it all out for her. I'm the first boyfriend shes ever had. She never dated anyone in high school so she got lucky with not having to deal with childish drama. We're going to Frank and Sons in the morning (her first time there), coming back to my place and relaxing with a nice massage (she loves them)  while we finish up our last four episode of Game of thrones season three. I have an intention to cook, but since I've been taking the bus. My funds are low and I haven't been able to buy anything to cook with. So I'm stuck with Easy Mac and a cake that I baked for her. A pizza would really help me out so I can at least buy food for the rest of the weekend so we can eat and if I'm lucky have some left over for Handel's (best ice cream ever). I just want to give her a relaxing day and weekend since she's been working so hard to pay for a new car. Thanks for considering to read all of that if you did!
