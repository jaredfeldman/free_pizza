So I'm pretty broke this month and just heard from work that I wont be needed for a few weeks meaning that I don't have any money coming in for a while. I heard this after getting back from a full day in uni and with a few hours of reading to do tonight so I would really appreciate some pizza. In return I will pay the favour forward when I get money again and send the redditor who makes me smile a story of some kind or photos of me looking happy :) please help me random knights of the internet.
