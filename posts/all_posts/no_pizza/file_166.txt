Hi there,  life is good and I have nothing to complain about. Today my mrs is going out wedding dress shopping for my upcoming Christmas wedding and I am going to sit and play GTA and have a few beers. A pizza would help make a good day great. Of course I will pass on the good Karma to a fellow RAOP user at a later date. Thanks :)
