I live in Goodyear, AZ.

I can receive pizza at an address nearby, however i got kicked out by my boyfriend today because we had a huge argument, sadly, he is the one that makes the money, i am a stay at home mom, he is watching 2 kids right now, i miss them and i want to go home, kind of desperate for pizza :) hopefully i get my wish :).
