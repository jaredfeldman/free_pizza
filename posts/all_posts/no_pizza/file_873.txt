Well this has been a let down and a half of a birthday. I'm 35, and sat at home on my computer watching my 3 year old daughter. The missus is 39 weeks pregnant and bedridden with blood pressure issues that had her in hospital for two weeks. There's no possibility of a celebration or even friends popping by as my work recently changed shift patterns and my mates are all on nights. Deciding to at least salvage something from the day i decided to defrost the freezer and threw my back out moving it to get at the power point. The final topping? Payday is 3 days away and i can't even order a takeaway for us this evening, resulting in me having to hop around like a bloody screaming ape to make food. Help me Reddit, you're my only hope!
