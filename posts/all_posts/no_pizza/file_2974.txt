it's been a busy busy term and i haven't been able to find a part-time job so the groceries have stretching since september and i just can't afford to get out to the grocery store right now. my cupboards hold nothing but an almost empty bag of pasta and my fridge just a can of tomato sauce. I need to do a lot of work this week, but I just can't concentrate due to weakness. Help me please and I promise to pay it forward. 

edit: i live in victoria, bc.
