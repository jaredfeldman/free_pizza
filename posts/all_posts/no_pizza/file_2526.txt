(Northern Colorado)

So here's my dilemma guys... My payroll made a mistake on Friday and it was too late to take care of before the next business day (fingers are crossed for tomorrow). The problem is that I literally live paycheck to paycheck a few day late check can really turn your world upside down. I'm starving for a bite to eat tonight and would be so grateful if someone could help me out. After I get my paycheck sorted out I'd be happy to pay it forward or just send a pizza back at you in appreciation. Whatever you want me to do to return the favor, just, please help.

Thanks Redditors,
