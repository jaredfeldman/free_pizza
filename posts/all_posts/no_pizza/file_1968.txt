~~Hi you guys. First I would like to say this thread and the people who frequent it are amazing. I've always been nervous to post here as I am usually too broke to reciprocate. I'm still broke, but when I get my tax return I definitely will reciprocate.~~

~~A little about me and why I'm posting: I live with my mom and work a minimum wage job in Southern California. (North County)~~

~~We have a three bedroom house that the bank is trying to foreclose on. Although this isn't a new situation for us, the guy who offered to do the home loan modification took two-thousand dollars of my and my mother's money and bailed. My mom's transmission also failed around last month so we've been taking the bus.~~

~~We have been able to manage lately, until recently when my sister and her husband declared they would not be paying my mom rent for staying here anymore, and I found out they had only been paying my mom seventy-five dollars each for the past four months. It has been a pretty big blow, albiet not surprising, and has now put an even greater strain on my mom and I.~~

~~As of yesterday SDGE came through and shut off our electricity. (I am writing via phone.) The bill is just over six-hundred dollars past due (I just found out) and my mom has been calling around trying to find help. I know it is probably stupid to request a pizza in lieu of everything else but I thought it would be a nice change from everything else going on right now.~~

~~I know sob stories are probably cliche here, and my apologies for that. Just figured I would give it a shot. If anyone is interested, I can also provide pictures of the SDGE notice on the meter, or whatever else.~~

~~So yeah. That's it. Thanks.~~

Edit: Overdrew the bank account to get the electricity back on, as it was needed for my mom. I downvoted my post, but just struck-out what I wrote so not to just simply delete as this board has advised against that.
