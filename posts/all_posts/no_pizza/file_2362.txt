Hello,

Before I ask my question I want to make it clear I am in no way accusing anyone of anything and I am in no position to buy anyone pizza in fact I am probably more in need of a pizza haha...

Anyway, I've noticed that most if not all requests from the UK seem to go unanswered, why is this? Is it not possible to buy pizza for someone in the UK from America? Or would people rather look after their own country men before others...

I'd really love to find a way to help my UK bros get some pizza. Any suggestions? Thank you.

Edit: I would love to get involved with any ideas people have.
