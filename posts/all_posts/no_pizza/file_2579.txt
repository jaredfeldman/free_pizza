So I'm new to this website and not really sure what it's about. I heard through a friend though that you guys helped him out by giving him a free pizza when he was in need so I'm here today to see if you could do the same for my roommates and I. The three of us moved into our first apartment today so none of us have a job at the moment and my financial aid won't be in until next week sometime! We are in need plz help! XD
