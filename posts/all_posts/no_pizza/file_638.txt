This month has been really hard on my family and I. We have had to pay our rent, car, and gas all late because of shortened hours at work. I am the only one working right now because my wife is on maternity leave which makes money really low. I have two children who love pizza and have been affected by this unfortunate turn of events. I promise to pay forward as soon as I get more hours from work.
