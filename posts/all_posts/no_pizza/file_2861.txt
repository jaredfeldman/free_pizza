Today while on a 5-6 hour hike, We returned to the city and I came home realizing that my ID'S Debits and all of that good stuff did not make it back with me and being in a new place this month the fridge and cupboards have nothing in them. Accept for a pouch of taco seasoning which might be ok but... 

Sadly being 10:43pm I cannot get my bank stuff figured out.
I do not want it for free I most defiantly want to barter here 
is a list of things I can provide.
-Pay it forwards once cards renewed
-Write you a personalized poem (Hand written and shipped by request)
- Anything graphic design or audio engineering related 
- a print of some of my art work (Sent by request)
- or anything you can come up with that I'm able.

I have never done this before I'm curious to see the outcome
Cheers :)
