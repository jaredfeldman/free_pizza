Howdy everyone,

The water heater in our house and the air compressor died in our truck, stealing money away from our grocery funds. If anyone could be so kind to buy us a pizza so my wife and I can eat something other than top ramen and corn, it would be appreciated so much. We aren't picky, just hungry, cheese or pepperoni would be fine. I can write a Haiku for the wonderful person who feeds us!
