 My sister and I haven't had a decent meal for the past 2 weeks due to our sick parents who lives in the Philippines. We've been sending them money to get the medicine they need. However, we're in a very desperate time in our lives and we really need a decent meal. 

Btw : We live in CT.

We are willing to pay it forward as soon as we get a chance.
