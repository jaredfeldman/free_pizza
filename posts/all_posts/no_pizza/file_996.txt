**CLOSED - FOUND HOT DOGS IN FREEZER**

My aunt is having problems with her husband(possibly getting a divorce) and had to get out of the house. It is my understanding he has been hiding money from her and only giving her enough to pay the bills leaving nearly nothing for her and their five kids.

I would buy the pizza myself buy I am unemployed. If someone would be kind enough to buy us some food I am sure we all would appreciate it.
