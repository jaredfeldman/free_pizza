It's my 22nd birthday today. Last night I moved into a place with my friend and we don't have much to celebrate with. Help make my birthday a little less lame, please. 

Also, my fiance is 29 weeks pregnant and craving pizza. 

There is a Pizza Hut within walking distance so we can pick up. Anything would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks for your time!
