for a week and a half now I've been surviving off of an egg a day, I just heard of this miraculous community service today, and ask some wealthy aristocrat to spare a few cents and allow me the delicious mouth party of one Pizzaville pizza, in my opinion the best pizza in Toronto.

Much love and respect
