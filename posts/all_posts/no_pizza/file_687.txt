Just an idea but I was wondering if anyone would be interested in ordering pizza's for the paralyzed veterans at the VA in ST Louis? A lot of the patients are older gentleman with no family and some of them end up staying for months or even years. I saw this reddit and recently [posted a story](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/up8ap/then_why_the_hell_did_you_give_it_to_me/c4xdiq2) about my roommate in a different sub, saw this sub and made me thank of him.

I was there for 4 months late last year and Remember the sunday dinners where the worst. If you are interested they eat dinner at 5PM CST, so if we ordered at 4PM it should arrive before they get dinner.

Jefferson Barracks SCI unit, Building 52 , St. Louis, MO 63125 

(be sure to put a note to deliver to nurses station and say it's for the vets and nurses if you want, the nurses there are pretty awesome and have a thankless job)

If anyone needs the correct numbers to call, let me know. I just thought they would be pleasantly surprised by a bunch of awesome pizza. There are usually about 18 patients but they upgraded the facility so now there are about twice that. At dinner time there are about 6-8 staff (nurses mostly). Anyways I'm going to order one for them also, I would do more but I'm broke and that's all I can afford :(

Edit: several of the nurses there are redditors, forgot to mention that :)
