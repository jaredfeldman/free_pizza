My neighbors upstairs have been playing the same god damn Wiz Khalifa song for the past hour, and show no signs of stopping. I've already tried all the usual stuff like asking my neighbors downstairs if I can sleep in their bed for the night, but they didn't seem so interested once they found out I suffer from debilitating night terrors and vomit inducing bouts of gas. 

If I knew how to [make my own pizza](http://cl.jroo.me/z3/R/1/u/d/a.aaa-pizza-man.jpg) I would gladly do that, but my head hurts and if I were to try and make it rain right now, it would be more like a Siberian hail storm of nickels and those Canadian pennies I can't get rid of.

Maybe if I'm lucky, I'll get a [vigilante delivery guy](http://gargles.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/DeliveryGuy2.jpg) to come save me.
