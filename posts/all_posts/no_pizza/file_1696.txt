Currently down on my luck, I'm unemployed, my cable got shut off yesterday and recently got dumped by my girlfriend. It's a Tuesdy evening and I'd love some pizza, what girl wouldn't? Anyone like to help me out?
Sitting alone in my room with just my stomach growling to keep me company :(

Oh and I'm located in WA state
