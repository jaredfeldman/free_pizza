We dont tend to have fast food pizza, we make all our own food at home, but we do enjoy a good hot pizza every now and then. We are incredibly unlikely to buy OURSELVES a pizza, as we tend to use our food money at the Farmer's Market, but if someone were to buy us a pizza today, I would definitely return the favor, or pay it forward, whichever the sender prefers. We are located in North Florida and we are not at all picky as to which chain the pizza comes from :)
