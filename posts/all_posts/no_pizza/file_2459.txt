Readers Digest version of today: My biological father (who hasn't been a part of my life) had all of his siblings message me and tell me that *I* was the reason he wasn't involved.  So, I spent a lot of the day crying.  On top of it, my baby has a double ear infection AND hand, foot, and mouth.  AND it's 102 degrees outside. Meaning the oven on would make it worse.  I know tomorrow is a new day, and will be better...but today, I would really like to enjoy a meal I didn't cook myself.  I know I could get dinner from pizza hut for like $15 including tip.  If anyone could help me out, I'd totally pay it forward when I have some extra cash.  If not, thanks for letting me get all that junk off my chest.
