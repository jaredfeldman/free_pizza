I've had a lot happen in the last year but I'm always trying to be positive and keep my head from sinking. I rode my water bill too long this time around. Now just a few days before I could pay them it's been shut off, and they've made it clear they won't cut it back on without payment first. I live mostly off instant noodles and macaroni, now I can't even boil water for a cup of tea. Right now my sink is loaded with dirty dishes that'll probably be ruined by the time I can run the dishwasher. I don't get anymore cash until this weekend, so the water isn't coming back anytime soon. I'm not working at the moment and I don't have wheels anymore either. My bank account is literally drawn down to the 70 cent mark, even if I had transport I couldn't buy anything substantial. 

When I asked a neighbor I get along with just to let me fill up a milk jug he told me no instantly. He acted like I was asking him at gun point. So he can borrow my edger, but me asking for a gallon of water is the line, apparently. I don't know what I'm going to do when I inevitably need to flush the toilet. I got a lot of time to come up with creative solutions but food isn't something I can come up with a fix for. I was going to live off spaghetti and macaroni until payday but now I'm stuck with no water to boil them in. I ate an uncooked ramen brick for a meal earlier, if I don't get some real food I think I'll go nuts. I can provide proof if someone needs it, I'll scan the note the left for me or whatever you guys wants. I'm being real here, I'm in a bad way and the end isn't in sight quite yet. Can anyone help me?
