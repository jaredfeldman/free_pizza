He's broke, he's hungry, he's a good guy who deserves a nummy pepperoni pizza while he packs for our [very expensive] move.  I'm too broke or I'd get it myself, we're both planning on paying it forward after our finances recover from the move.

FWIW, he's also too proud to ask for himself, which is why i'm posting, info sent will be to get pizza to him at home, if that matters.
