I recently just joined Reddit! I heard about this service...and my title writes itself. I honestly think this is to good to be true. I'm chillin with my folks in Stafford, TX and [no sob story] I dont always order pizza...
"BUT WHEN I DO I MAKE SURE IT'S THE MOST INTERESTING ORDER EVER" School resumes for me on Tuesday, and to go back to my friends with a story of how I got pizza sounds sort of ecstatic to me! LOL Meat lovers anyone?
