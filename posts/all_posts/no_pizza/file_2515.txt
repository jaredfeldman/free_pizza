Someone stole $100 from my landlord and employers bedroom. No one is fessing up and now Im fucked. No more job, or home. I seriously regret hosting parties for my fuckwad friends. Now without a car, Ive got a whole shitload of issues to solve. I got $5 to my name, and if it werent for lack of availability, Id be back on the H train. Clean 3 months now, and the dope dreams are back in fulll force. 

This doesnt even cover half of it. Its enough to not personally identify me without a throwaway account.
