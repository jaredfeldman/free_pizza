I keep seeing these videos popping up on YouTube. You know the one's with the really depressing music and the guy sitting in a dark room holding up signs. I figured why not try it out and see if someone is generous enough to reward My starving roommates (Brother and his GF) and I with some Pizza. I would put more info about our situation but I will let the depressing video do the talking for me.

My Brother his Girlfriend and I just moved from Portland Oregon up to Redmond Washington for a job that we got offered. She currently isn't working and tomorrow is our payday as of right now we have no money or food. I have been eating my Christmas candy but that isn't helping at all, in fact it's making me feel worse. I would LOVE for a Reddit to give us a Pizza. Of course I will help out another down and out Redditor next week when I do have my paycheck.

Thanks
