Hey all, 
It's been nice reading some of the stories on here, Didn't think I would ever contribute one of my own but here goes.
Basically long story short I lost my wallet last weekend and had to cancel all my cards, 
I'm an international student here a couple of thousand miles from home while not entirely on my own I've been making do with the 20euros I had in my pocket since Friday.
I was hoping I might get a new card today it never came and now I'm looking at recycling some empty bottles so I can buy some bread for the evening.
If someone fancied the challenge of ordering pizza on a Finnish website I would be forever grateful as I really don't want to go asking friends for some spare dinner on Valentines day.
