Been out of work for two weeks, but my new job in NYC starts on Monday.  It'll be another two weeks before my first paycheck and it's getting scary putting everything on the credit card.  Pizza sounds awesome on a Saturday... while I sit at home and catch up on some new episodes of adventure time...
