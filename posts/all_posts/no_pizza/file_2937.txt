having the very worst of luck lately... i could go into detail, but you've probably seen plenty of sob stories already... the long story short version: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING positive has happened to me over the month of november... and i'm moving thursday when i get paid (hopefully enough to cover the move)

i tried this once before but to no avail so here goes again... and once i'm settled and maybe have a tiny bit of good luck at all paying it forward will be on the top of my to do list...
