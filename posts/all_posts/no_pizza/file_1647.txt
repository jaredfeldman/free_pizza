Hey RaoP! I'm writing on behalf of my roommates (and myself!) in request for some pizza!  We're extremely low on cash at the moment due to rent and the last bit of money we did have, we can't access due to a stolen debit card :(

If anyone would be willing to give us some pizza, we'd be really grateful!  My roommate, [Foolgroove](http://www.reddit.com/user/Foolgroove) will even draw you a picture :)

Thanks,
