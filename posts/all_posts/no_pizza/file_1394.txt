Hiya, this is for my friend, not me. She's a freelance makeup artist juggling several part-time gigs and school and she's been having a hard time making ends meet lately. She had an especially shitty day today and I'd love to send her a pizza to cheer her up, but I'm currently unemployed (yay) so I thought maybe Reddit could help me.

**Edit: Oooops, she recently moved to Long Island; I forgot.**
