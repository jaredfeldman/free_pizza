I'm already a bit strapped for cash this summer.  But I manage to have a good time.  Unfortunately, on my way to my friend's house last night in the Champaign region, I got robbed at gunpoint near my house.  While he didn't get really any money from me, he got my phone, ID, and cards, and without those, I can't use the little money I have, especially since all of those will have to be replaced... for money.  :/  My friend suggested this to me, and I was wondering if any of you could help me out.  Thanks for listening ^_^.
