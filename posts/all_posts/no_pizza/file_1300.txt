I asked for help in r/assistance and someone was kind enough to give me $45 for help on my credit card a week ago. Now I'm out of groceries and  the credit card bill is getting dangerously higher. This pizza would GREATLY help me out.  I'll pay it forward as soon as I start getting my steady income back!

Edit:

dontlikerainbows helped me out! I now have food to tide me over until Tuesday!
