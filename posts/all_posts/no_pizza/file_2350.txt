I am a  broke student at the University of Oregon sitting in my inferno of a house. It's 91 degrees today, which might not seem drastic to many, but it's the hottest day since I have been at school and there is no way we have air conditioning, let alone more than one small fan. Pizza would be greatly appreciated, prevent myself from venturing into the humid warzone that is the outdoors.
