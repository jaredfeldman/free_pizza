My dad passed away on July 11th and I've been supporting my mom since her income was based on him. She was his caregiver. I've managed all of her financial issues lately, because she has a hard time asking others for help, so I've done everything from collecting donations on gofundme for the cremation costs and asking family and friends for money for her living costs for her. It has been exhausting. Plus she lives a few hours away so I've been shelling out so much in gas.

Meanwhile I started a new job and training hours were slim this past couple weeks. I also go to school; just an online class this summer, but normally full time. I'm not usually so broke, but this past month or so has been really rough. My wife and I would adore a pizza during this time! I would also be happy to come back and fund a pizza for someone else. 

Thanks for reading!
