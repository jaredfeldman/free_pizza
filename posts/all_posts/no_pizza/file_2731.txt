So one day two redditors decide they want to start a petting zoo. So one redditor said to the other redditor, "you go out and find the land, I will go out and find the animals." They agree and set off on their ways.

So the redditor out looking for the animals was walking down the street when he sees a roster store. He walks in and tells the guy he wants to buy a rooster. They guy says, "okay, but we don't call them roosters, we call thems "cocks". " 

He says, "okay", buys the roster, and sets off on his way.

He continues walking down the street when he sees a chicken store. He walks in and tells the guy he wants to buy a chicken. They guy says, "okay, but we don't call them chickens, we call thems "pullits". " 

He says, "okay", buys the chicken, and continues on.

A little while later he is walking down the street when he sees a donkey store. He walks in and tells the guy he wants to buy a donkey. They guy says, "okay, but we don't call them donkeys, we call thems "asses", and there is something very peculiar about this ass, you have to scratch his ass every five minutes or he'll die. " 

Its the last donkey in the store, so he says, "okay", buys the donkey, and sets off on his way.

So now this redditor is walking down the street, all three animals in his arms when five minutes go by. He gets really frantic, runs up to the first redditor he sees, and says, "*will you grab my cock and pullit, while I scratch my ass*?"
