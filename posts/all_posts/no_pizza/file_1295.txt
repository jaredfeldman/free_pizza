~~I have managed to pay off tuition with 17$ left in my checking account and 200$ worth of credit card debt. I have been eating ramen noodles for the past week and would love some sort of meat on a pizza. Also lost my job and trying to find another so i need the money I have left for gas.. Help me RAOP, you're my only hope~~

Thanks to Stalked_Like_Corn, he is freaking awesome.
