I'm dealing with some severe depression, caused by mental illness and right now all my money is being thrown at my doctors to help me get through this. I have little food in my home, all of which needs to last me until the 8th when I can go grocery shopping again. I'm feeding myself, so I don't need a lot, really anything will help. I'm in Salem, OR if that helps any. Thanks.
