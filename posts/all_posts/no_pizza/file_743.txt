well I am 8 weeks preggers...my name is Sarah..and..well I'm pretty freaked out about telling my story too so meny unknowns...but my friend said people would understand and not be mean..so here it is..
as of 2 days ago...my husband left me,after he found out we were having a baby...mind you we have been married 2 yrs and friends for 8 yrs...he took everything..our money and car and left me in a house with no food..its not like a can eat a lot due to being so upset n morning sickness but it'd b nice to have something to munch on when I can...I called my old boss and luckily I'll b able to go back to my old job in a few weeks...I'm just praying someone will understand and help out..I've never done this b4...but its worth a try...god bless and thank you for reading my story
