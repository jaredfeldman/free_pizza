My friend has helped me with a place to stay and food until I get on my feet and she is having a difficult time herself as a single mother of 1. She didn't need to help me out but after my daughter had open heart surgery I lost everything and after being homeless and hungry for the last 8 months her helping me recently is helping me get my whole life back on track.  She doesn't have much but still is giving and got me out of the homeless shelter!

We do have food so if there's anyone going without please help them.  If there's more to go around we sure could use it and I know her and her son would be very grateful!  Thanks!
