I preemptively realize that this post is at a severe risk of sounding like a pity party, but I want to make it clear that I am not trying to create a sob story here. But, I also want to be honest. Know that I am happy (pizza or not)! With that disclaimer out of the way, here is sort of what is happening in my life, cliff-note style.

-I am poor in the college-student sort of way. My parents are broke, so I worked my way through college working for AT&amp;T 40 hours a week.

-I did well in college

-Upon graduating, I received a US government grant to move to Taiwan for a year.

-Yay!

-However, there was a six month gap between college and moving to Taiwan, one that was really hard to fill with employment. So, we are pretty broke.

-The last few weeks of my life have been insane. Applying for visas, passports, getting medical clearances, seeing every doctor in town, selling my car, buying a new wardrobe, packing or selling everything I own... you get the idea. My GF and I have been waking up, scrambling all day, and going back to bed. We are exhausted and broke.

-I am leaving to Taiwan in 4 days, and I still have so much to do that it's quite upsetting.

-From what I understand, the pizza situation in Taiwan is quite depressing :(

So, I ask for some help for my GF and I, one last chance to eat some pizza before we move on into the unknown (and one less thing to have to figure out tonight as we continue packing).

I had always read about this sub-reddit, but never participated. I always figured that if I did, I would be giving away a pizza. But, at the moment, it seems life put me in the position of the requester.

Pizza or not, I think this is a really cool subreddit, and I am super excited to be moving abroad, despite all the stress involved with preparing.

Thanks for listening, and I can't wait until I am in a position to be the pizza giver.

EDIT: Sorry, I am in the Atlanta, GA area. I just re-read the info site and noticed I missed this bit.
