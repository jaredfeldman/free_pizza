I'm in between jobs right now and am living in a house for free, as long as I get my own food since there isn't much to go around. Long story short, I'm out of savings and stuff to sell and still haven't been able to get another job, and for the past few days haven't had anything to eat. Any pizza, even if it's a small cheese, would be amazing. I can do most freshman/sophomore college level work, especially math up to calculus, if anyone would like that in return but don't really have anything else besides eternal gratitude and a promise to pay it forward when I can. Thanks for reading!
