I made the genius decision to avoid my drunk ex-boyfriend who usually is so wasted by 7pm on Fridays that he starts harassing me at the bar with "I know I just dumped you but maybe it was the worst decision I've ever made" by staying in tonight. I've also made the genius decision not to drink which would inevitably cause me to pathetically text him until he pays attention to me. I'm craving extra cheese pizza like whoa. If someone feels generous, help a bitter lady stay in and watch Star Trek. It would restore my faith in the fact that a lonely reddit life is absolutely better than the real world.
EDIT...SO many likes...no pizza. :(
