I got the money but I'm stuck at work. Would anyone brave the mean streets of Dearborn, MI to bring me a Little Caesars Hot and Ready? I can pay pal you the cash in front of you, or charge my register the amount.

To be clear, you only need to purchase the pizza upfront and I will be happily pay you the 5.30 for it.
