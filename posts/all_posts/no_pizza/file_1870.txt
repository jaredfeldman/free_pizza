I was working in the kitchen when I elbowed a steak knife that was on the edge of the counter (I didn't notice it, foolishly) and it fell onto my foot... Proof is in the a post to r/health on my page (this is a throwaway account).

I'd be grateful to anyone who could help me out with getting a pizza. I can't go to an ER until tomorrow (the only time I can get a ride to do so). 

If further proof is needed I'll take another picture of my foot with a date and time card next to it. Thanks in advance to anyone with offers.

I understand that this is an odd post and I'm embarrassed about it, honestly, but I can't work in the kitchen to make top ramen tonight, hell, I haven't even cleaned up the mess on the floor yet. :/

Edit:Got to an ER. Still haven't eaten and can't walk. Would still love a pizza if anyone's willing.
