First time pizza poster- [NYC AREA] So I spent a good hour cutting  fresh chicken breasts, brushing egg yolk on them, some flour, a lot of bread crumbs and deep frying them to deliciousness. Tried to eat them with my girlfriend while studying for biology in our tiny apartment and boom- plate falls on the floor. Oh, and I also lost my Playstation 3 to a bunch of Frat boys who threw a party with my roomate who by accident spilled an entire cup of alcohol into the top vent. shitty, shitty 48 hours its been. =/ needless to say- low on cash and virtually no food in the fridge. Heres a picture of one of the plates   http://imgur.com/wLsKh 

Oh and also, I want to state that my girlfriend does not believe at all this sub reddit exists and that random people actually send pizza to strangers -randomly. 

TL;DR- Shitty 48 hours, home made chicken fingers fell on the floor. starving. Tummy feels sad.
