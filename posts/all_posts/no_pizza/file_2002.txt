I'll spare you the hard luck story; I'm sure you've heard it before. My partner and I have been battling the economy for a couple of years now. We've been blessed with a place to live and been able to keep the electricity and the tubes, but food has been scant and invariably cooked by me. A pizza would be a goddess-send. We're in the SF Bay Area, CA. I know I'm a new account; I would be happy to provide proof that I'm a real person.
