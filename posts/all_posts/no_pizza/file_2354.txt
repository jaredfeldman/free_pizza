I'm in Australia (Sydney) and am v hungry! I've opened my own counselling/psychotherapy business which I'm so passionate about. I love helping people. This has meant that I've spent all my money. I'm sure it will all be worth it but in the meantime I'm scraping by on next to no money.

I've finally been on Reddit for a month which I think makes me eligible.  

I too would love to take part in offering pizza once I'm financially on my feet again. 

Thank you so much to who ever even considers feeding me!
