This is my first post ever, I'm not totally sure how this site works. Anyways, I found this subreddit and thought you guys might be able to help us. My fiance and I... well, we're poor. We live in my mom's (finished) basement. He hasn't had work in 3 weeks and had to give his truck away. We also have a sweet 8 month old baby boy, who makes me smile every day. I am breastfeeding, though, and I worry I'm not getting enough calories. 

We are in Michigan.
