I lost my wallet Tuesday. I am unable to get cash from the bank because they are a credit union located in another city three hours away (my hometown). I have to wait for a new debit card to come in the mail. Should be any day now, but in the meantime I would love a hot pizza. I can only eat what's left in the house, and I'm running out quickly. I would love to pay it forward once I get my card in the mail. Can someone help me out please?
