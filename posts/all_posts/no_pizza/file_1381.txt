I haven't worked in weeks and unemployment is taking forever to go through. I ran out of stuff to sell, owe 2 different friends a lot of money, and am in desperate need of food. I rode a bus and walked the rest of the way to a local food bank, they said I needed an appointment. Called to make one, they aren't taking appointments right now, WTF.

So a little while ago I dialed 211 and tried the United Way, they helped my mom a lot when I was little. She got abuse counseling, food, clothes, utilities, everything practically free from them. I told them straight up, I ain't got a car, their exact words were none of my local banks deliver, thanks for calling, click. I called back three times and every time they keep sending me to the same place that already told me no.

Reddit you're my last hope. I saw the story a few months back, didn't need it then but I need it now. When United Way gives you the shaft you know it's bad. If I gotta walk five miles to get it I'll do it, I don't need the exercise but I need food. I feel like I've been walking the desert for a minute and ten hours. Hope there's some love flowing through here today for me. Peace. 

Forgot to mention I'm in Jacksonville, Florida.
