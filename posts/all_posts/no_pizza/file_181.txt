I graduated from college in December (yay!) without help from my family and relocated from the devastating economy of Michigan in hopes of better opportunities. I've spent all my money on bills and gas for the last week to go to interviews, which unfortunately, leaves me with nothing left for food. I'd love to not go hungry tonight... and hopefully one of these interviews results in a job &amp; I can pay it forward ASAP. â™¥
