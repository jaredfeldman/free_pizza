I'll keep this short, but a failed transmission have put my partner and I behind close to around $1000 with repairs, hotels, and other things. We were heading to Boston, already booked, and couldn't cancel our hotel, losing us another couple hundred. While we should be able to get going again tomorrow, we are between paychecks and would really appreciate the help of anyone who is willing to help.

At this point, we are hungry, not picky at all, and hoping to repay this subreddit back when we're back in Montana. 

If you're willing to help, please let me know. I will do whatever I can to repay it to you, or on your behalf.
