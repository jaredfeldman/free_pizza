Hi RandomActsOfPizza, 

So, I'm having a terrible weekend. I got given a weeks notice at my "job" last week, and other places I've been talking to aren't calling me back. I'm going to run out of money soon, and now I've spent the last three days at home sick, and I am not even going to get my last couple days pay if I can't get well enough to go to work. I had my phone stolen a month ago, and my computer has nearly completely stopped working(and the warranty service has been ignoring me for two months), I'm not sure if I can post this without it freezing again. 
RAOP, I'm tired, and hungry, and sick, and so discouraged. Would any kind soul be able to help me out?

Thanks so much.
