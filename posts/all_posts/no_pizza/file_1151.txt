Hope this isn't too edgy for this subreddit- don't want to offend anyone.

Hello awesome and generous Redditors of Randoms Acts of Pizza!  
You may have heard of (or are perhaps participating yourself!) [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/) 30 days of literary abandon!  I am currently attempting to log my sexual memoirs during this event as a writing experiment for myself.  I am home pounding away at the keys trying to catch up and reach my word count goals and recall details that have escaped me in moments of passion ; )

I'm home with the SO and we are both very hungry and equally broke doing the starving artist/starving writer thing.  Anyone who can relate to this situation and is in a position to help us out with dinner would be our hero!!  I would love to share the fruits of my labor from this evenings writing with whoever helps me out.  If you are intrigued to read it, I will send you a private work in progress vignette from my pizza nourished efforts!
