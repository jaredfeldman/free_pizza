Hi, RAOP. First timer here.

Nothing terribly special... UK dweller (South East Coast represent) who lost my job last August, ekeing out a living for the last 6 months or so on my severance pay but nothing has come up yet.

I've held out for as long as I can without making a claim for any benefits (which I've just started on) and have been living super frugal for the last month or so. 39p pasta sauce and a can of tuna only gets you so far before you want to throw in the towel. Come Monday I can stock up on some more varied food stuffs again (and pick up those Skyrim PS3 DLCs that have been rubbing my nose in my shitty financials) but right now, I'm hankering for some comfort food.

If someone can help me out, I'll be paying this forward at a later, more  financially stable, time.

Peace out, fellow Dovah. Your love is appreciated.
