I don't have a sob story. I have things I could eat. I don't have much extra cash for pizza, and pizza sounds pretty good right now. 

If nobody sends me pizza, I'll be just fine. 

I'll trade you a cute picture of my cats. And I'll pay it forward when I get paid at the end of the month.

Have a good weekend!
