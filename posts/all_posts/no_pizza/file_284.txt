I've been working on a Web Publishing final all day, and am finally nearing completion. Though in the process, I forgot to get to the cafe in time to get myself a decent meal. All I've got here is cheese and bread, and while a staple, just isn't enough.

Would anyone care to give a RAOP PapaJohn's e-giftcard? They're the only place around here.

Edit - I suppose I should go ahead and mention I'm in Ohio. :)
