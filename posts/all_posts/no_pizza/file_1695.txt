I would love a pizza right now.  I don't need it; there's no sad story to my life that would make a pizza truly beneficial right now; I just feel like eating pizza.  I understand if no one wants to buy me one, but I would greatly appreciate it.  If you want, I could photoshop your name to look cool or something like that.  This is my first time asking for pizza, so if you have any kind of request in return, such as a wallpaper, I will gladly oblige.
