So I'm desperate... I lost my job last week after my boss found out I was moving when the semester ends. Being an idiot, I didn't have very much money saved up. So now I'm really hungry, and have no food, or money. I'll pay it forward when I find work again.

Update: Chaosmosis came through and is just so many kinds of awesome!
