hey reddit,
         
                  we are a 23 and 22 year old married couple no kids or anything but my wife is a student and i work at a crap job. i dont get paid til the end of the week and she just had to deal with some family problems so i was trying to cheer her up. i dont want to go into details abot what shes going through or anything. its personal but i can assure you even the smallest thing at this point would cheer her up. i just love her so much and hate to see her upset. ive used this site before and have bought pizzas for people before i was just wondering if i could possibly get one today and i could pass the favor on at the end of the week. thanks for at least reading this i hope you find it in your heart to help us. thanks again.
