I'm currently sitting at a McDonalds, where I slept in my truck last night, with no gas and no money for food. I didn't get anything to eat yesterday, and so far today it's looking like it's gonna be the same way. There is a Pizza Hut within walking distance, and would really appreciate any kind of food. It really sucks to have to ask for something like this, but it's either this or go outside and beg for money face to face.
