I'm indulging myself by spending the weekend doing nothing but reading The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson. A 1007 page fantasy epic. I'm about 250 pages in already and just realized that I'm hungry. Now I'm afraid I'm too sucked into the story to take a half hour away from the book to make something to eat and I lack the orbs* to order food brought to me. So I throw myself at the internet's mercy. Be kind and send pizza before I die of an engaging plot.
