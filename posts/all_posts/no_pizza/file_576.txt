so, my brother and his g/f just moved out of our apartment a couple weeks ago, and it's been great having the place to myself until i can get a new roommate... unfortunately, it's left me also having to pay rent and bills entirely on my own.. which, as of this week, has left me with $2 in my bank account, no more food in my fridge, and a really big appetite, since i've had (literally) nothing but ramen for the last two days.

i would really appreciate any help, and if this works out, when i get paid on Thursday, i'll make an [Offer] thread to try and pay it forward.

thanks in advance!!
