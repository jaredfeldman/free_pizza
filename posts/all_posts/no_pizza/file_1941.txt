But I was pleasantly surprised to click on it, only to find such a cool subreddit! I looked through the posts- there are a lot of sad stories, and a lot of pizzas mending some rough situations. While I don't have any such problems in my life, I do love both pizza and kindness, and I would be *elated* to be on the receiving side of such a great combo!

Combo makes me think of pizza. Mmmmmm.

I live in Chicago, IL, right next to Clark and Division, visiting my girlfriend (my home is in the Bay Area of California). I don't do evil things, try my best to smile every day, love black olives, and want to give a warm thank you to everyone who reads this!
