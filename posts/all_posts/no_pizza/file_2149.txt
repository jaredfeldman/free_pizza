Dammit, I forgot the location. I'm sorry! Location is **St. John's, NL, Canada**

Today, I moved. I spent the past 2 hours throwing boxes and a bed onto a truck, dragging that across the city, and then hurling it into a new bedroom. It has been 27 degrees here in St. John's (80F) and the humidity isn't exactly being kind either. I've already taken a shower. I feel like a new one.

I could make food, I'm not going to lie. I've got boneless/skinless chicken breasts downstairs, I've got pasta and sauces, I've got marshmallows. However, I'd really just like to kick up on Canada Day, relax, and munch on some pizza. Can provide any proof you'd like.
