For obvious reasons, I created a new account for this request. To prove that I'm not just trolling you guys, I took [a picture](http://imgur.com/a/r24Lh) of my medication bottle and some of the literature I was given at the appointment where I had to terminate the pregnancy. 

Before anyone judges me (though I know this is a friendly group of people; I have been fortunate enough to receive before under my real username), I believe I did the right thing, and my partner didn't just abandon me after I did this. I got the (*gulp*) abortion on Friday, and he made sure I was taken care of during the worst of the aftermath. But today, he's at work, and I'm pretty much confined to the couch. There is food in the house, but it's stuff I'd have to prepare. Preparing a real meal for just myself while I'm still crampy doesn't seem like fun right now...

I'm willing to reveal my identity and real username to the person willing to gift me, in private of course, to also prove that I've been on reddit for quite some time. I also have a few bucks here for a tip for a delivery driver (I obviously can't drive right now). 

I know there are people on here who haven't received who are more deserving, but I'd love some comfort food. Absolute understanding if no one feels like it, though. :-)
