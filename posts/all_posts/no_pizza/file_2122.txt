I was really hoping to not have to do this... but I lost the work study job I've had for a year just a week after coming back to school about a month ago, and haven't found one to replace it yet. So I have no money, and on top of that, used my last meal swipe for the week last night at the cafeteria. I don't get to use next week's swipes until Monday, and I currently don't have any other source for food. A gift card for just one pizza would get me through the rest of the weekend, and once I find another job, I'll pay it forward to someone else in need. Really appreciate any help. Thank you!
