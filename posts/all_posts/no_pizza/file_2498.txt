So after 40 weeks, it's finally here!  Baby Boy should be making an appearance some time in the next week!  (This is our first) I am showing pretty much no pre-labor signs, except for being a little crampy and irritable, last night I had about 5 braxton hicks contractions.  My fiance is working all day and we unfortunately are living paycheck to paycheck (which is a bit easier when I am actually able to work) and have every penny pinched for the baby.  I am crazy craving some pizza,  I have a bad gluten intolerance (almost had to be hospitalized the last time I ate normal pizza, it was the last glutenous thing I purposefully ate before I made the switch to gluten free everything), so I know that makes it a bit more difficult (and expensive :( ), but I do live in Portland, OR so there are a couple of gluten free places (like hot lips or Bellagios) that do deliver.  I would love you forever and ever and ever and I could craft you something if you'd like.  I haven't had many cravings this entire pregnancy (except meat, I was vegetarian before I got pregnant, now I am a carnivore) and now it is pizza overload.  Someone help a pregnant girl (who is not royal by any means) out?
