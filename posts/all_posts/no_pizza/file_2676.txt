This is a throwaway/new account, but please don't let that scare you away. I am just your average 30 something unemployed, unpublished, unshaven (the 3 U's) author wannabe with a dream of getting published. I don't believe that things in life are free and I won't start believing that now. I'm offering to write a small but entertaining fantasy story for you. And yes, it has to be SFW and such as I will post the contents of this story for all to read.

If you'd like to read about a murder/mystery with break dancers or prefer your gnomes to carry gnome-made machine weaponry while riding raptors, I'm your man. You can toss some ideas my way if you're looking for something extra strange. 

Please note, I am hungry but I feel much more comfortable working for my food. Thank you for reading my post and remember a day above ground is always better than the alternative. Make each day count!
