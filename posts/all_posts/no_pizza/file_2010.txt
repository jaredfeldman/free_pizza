Just what the title says. Low on cash, unscheduled from my job, and my girlfriend left me, all within a couple weeks of one another. I've been struggling through job and internship applications, and trying to keep my head up, but it's not going great. My sleep and eating schedules have taken a dive as a result. Not to speak of my mood, most of the time. I'm not starving or anything, but it's a pretty rough situation.

If any kindly redditor would be willing to send a pizza my way (it'd be dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow), I'd be very grateful, and promise to pay it forward the moment I can afford to do so. If not, that's okay - someone on here probably needs it more than me.
