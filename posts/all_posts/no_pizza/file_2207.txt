So I'm a massive idiot who didn't bother checking my new debit card worked before moving away from home and to uni. So at present I'm living off my supplies and roommates good will. But classes begin tomorrow and I think my stomach is in danger of imploding from lack of food :O

I would be infinitely grateful if this was answered. I might make a nice little card on Publisher. (If I have publisher? I'll do something)
