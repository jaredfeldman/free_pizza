So its pretty much what I stated in my title. I'm a relatively poor college kid making a living on Ebay buying/selling/refurbishing iPhones and other electronics. This month didn't go so well and I don't have money until my next paypal payment is processed. (Can provide proof of this)

In return I can fix/root/upgrade/whatever your cell phone or other personal electronic or draw you a really bad picture! I could also be your lane-mate in Dota 2 (I play a mean Omniknight)

If you can't give pizza an internet high five would also do the trick!
