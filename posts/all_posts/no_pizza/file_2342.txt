[Long Island, new york] If someone would pull through, that would be amazing. i'm pretty much out of food/money until next wednesday.[ i'm spending the night over at my cousins friday but i have nothing to eat today or tomorrow D: just some easter candy.. lol, there are plenty of people who are in worse shape than i am but i thought i would give this a shot. thanks for reading :D 


EDIT: also, i'll give you some cool TF2 stuff over steam, the only thing i have to offer :( i might have a 42 hour live card? I could mail you some xbox games like skyrim and stuff depending on your location :}
