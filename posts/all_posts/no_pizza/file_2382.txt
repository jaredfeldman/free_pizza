My car broke down and so I lost my job. The car was required for the job. My ex-employer is fighting my unemployment claim. It seems like they want to punish me for leaving them at a busy time so no help there.  I  My dog and I will have to move into my friend's shed at the end of the month. my dog is like my child and my last dollar went to feeding him. I'm very depressed. I spend 70-80 hours a week looking for work to no avail since I have no car any more. It would be angelic if someone could lift my spirits with a pizza.  I have verification if I'm fortunate enough to get a little help. Thank you and I hope everyone has a great day.- Jason
