Mom decided to ditch us to get her nails done and hit up a bar, she left us pancakes for breakfast and nothing for lunch and dinner God knows when she'll be back. Tried texting our dad but he responded with "Busy at work". Our fridge has some stuff in it but nothing really edible by itself sadly. No other options left except ask the RAOP community! Help us RAOP you're our only hope!
