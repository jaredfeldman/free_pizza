24, San Francisco. I've been working at my new job for a few months, and it's been up and down for some time. This last paycheck, I had to buy a bunch of furniture for my new apartment, and had scheduled my bills and payments particularly close together, knowing I'd be cutting it close to my next paycheck.

Come tuesday, my debit card was declined for a payment that I knew was coming. I went to check my account and it turns out my gym membership had not been paid, draining my bank account to about 20 dollars.  Adding insult to injury I got sick on thursday, and half of my stuff is at my new apartment.

So here I am sitting alone in a half empty apartment with  no money, sick, broke, and waiting till the 30th to get back on my feet. Any help between now and then would be awesome, and I promise to pay back the ROAP by matching the help given to me.

PM me for details, I have my verification number ready.
