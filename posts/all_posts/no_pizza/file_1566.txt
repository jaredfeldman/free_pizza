20 years old and I've been unemployed since I finished a 6 month contract in March, and I'm living in my parents' loft. I buy all my own food and pay the very little rent that I can out of my Jobseekers' Allowance, and afterwards have maybe £10-20 a week to do what I like with (including putting money towards my damned £35/month phone bill that I'm locked into 'til August). But hey, it's had an accidental benefit of forcing me to cut down on smoking, 'cos that's just too damn expensive.

I had an interview and a whole bunch of assessments for a great job last week and absolutely aced it. I personally thought I had the job in the bag, and at the very end of the interview I asked when I'd be hearing from them - they told me I'd know today, and then said they've got a few more interviews to do first for *in-house applicants*. Gulped, but whatever. Got to today, and I've sat there next to my phone and checking my emails feverishly. It's now 9PM and I've had no call. So here's to more unemployment.

And frankly, I'm getting sick of cheap noodles and various soups and could do with something nice so I can play Deus Ex and feel at least a little better for tonight before I keep on applying everywhere and wait for my lucky break so that I can tell other people that a situation like this doesn't last forever.

Thanks, Reddit (:
