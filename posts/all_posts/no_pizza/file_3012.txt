Hello Reddit. I am very afraid of you. o Ao

I am a 23 year old from Marietta, GA. I lost my job on my birthday back in May and haven't been able to find anything since. I've been doing art commissions since then to try and boost my morale and keep my chin up, but they've slowed a bit and I just paid a student loan payment. With next to nothing in my fridge, $34 in my bank account and a phone bill coming up, I'm broke and hungry.

I'm also really scared of rejection! o Ao 

Also, if you're interested in anime-style art commissions or anything of the like, please let me know and I'll get you a link to my deviantART page. After all, that will help me out just as much as a pizza!

Thank you for looking!
