We have been living off left over turkey stuffing and rationing cutting up hot dogs into it while sick for the past few days. We are broke until the end of the month and could really use anything. A 12$ large pepperoni would be ideal since its cheap for you and enough food to to last us tonight and even breakfast tomorrow.

Thanks to anyone who even takes the time to look at this.
