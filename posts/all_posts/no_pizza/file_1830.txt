I was just informed that I have been retroactively fired on May 18, 2011. I have been out of work with an injury and I was just about to go back when I got this lovely news via email. As you can imagine this has thrown me into a panic over how I am going to pay for rent and food. It will all work out, it always does, but things look a bit bleak at the moment. I would love a pizza to eat while I go over my resume!
