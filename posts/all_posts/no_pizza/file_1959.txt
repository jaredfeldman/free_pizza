So I'm in college now and am on a very limited budget...unfortunately, it's all been expended on books and food from earlier this semester (mostly books, they're about $100 a pop now). 

I'm really living off of a stockpile pasta and this point...which gets VERY old fast. So, I would like to request a random act of pizza tonight! I can't tell you how happy it would make me!! 

I'm in Washington, DC, by the way.

Also, I can submit you a picture of my bank account...which has a mere 87 cents in it now. I'm not sure how to post it on this page!!
