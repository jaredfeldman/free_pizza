Hi there. Im currently stuck on an Army base and our DEFAC (basically a cafeteria where they serve our meals) is closed. All DEFACs across post are closed. SO, If you would like to order me a pizza, you can rest assured you will have the favor returned on the 1st of August when i get paid. Also a little info on myself, Combat Medic, two years in service, live on Ft Stewart, GA, and Im out of money because I spent it all on my sons birthday when I was on leave last week. Alright thats it, lets hope this works.
