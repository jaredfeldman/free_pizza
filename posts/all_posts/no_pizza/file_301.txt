There was fraudulent activity on my account Thursday morning. I got a call and an e-mail from my bank saying that they froze my account and when I confirmed that the charges were in fact fraud cancelled my card. A new one is on it's way, but that doesn't help me with my hunger today. I can provide proof with the e-mail they sent me Thursday morning. 
Thanks Everyone!
