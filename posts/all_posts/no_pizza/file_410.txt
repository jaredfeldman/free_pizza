Alright, this isn't me, but my friend. He's a pre-law student trying to get into rapping. He's written about a dozen songs now about political issues/social issues/weed etc. and is about to go into a recording studio tomorrow to get his first demo recorded. He's completely baked right now and is aching for a pizza. Any redditor wanna wish him good luck tomorrow with a pizza and a drink?
