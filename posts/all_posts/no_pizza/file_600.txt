Basically just heard about this sub from a friend and the idea kinda blew my mind. "Who the hell gives out free pizza to complete strangers?" might have been my exact response.

There is literally nothing wrong with me or my living conditions except my roommate wanted to keep his TV on all of last night at what I can only assume was max volume. After like 30 minutes of trying to sleep, I got up to turn it off and he was already asleep. I gave him a look that said, "Really, bro?" but he obviously didn't pick up on it. He then woke up again at some point, turned it on again and promptly went back to sleep. I slept in for my first class. But he's a really nice guy otherwise, probably.

So yeah, I'm here in Buffalo, NY and there is literally nothing wrong with my life except that I'm in Buffalo, NY. But I would definitely appreciate a random pizza nonetheless.
