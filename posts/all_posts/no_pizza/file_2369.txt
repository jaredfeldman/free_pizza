Long story short, been looking for a job to no avail - bills are adding up, and I've got very little money for food this month. Also - food stamps have not been gotten yet, went today to the DHS but don't have an appointment for another 2 days. 

If anyone could help out I'd really appreciate it, I can make a drawing or write you a poem, lend you a book, anything!
