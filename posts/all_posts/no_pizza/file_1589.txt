We have been playing for 3 days and cannot make it to our cafeteria for fear of being turned into Zombies. We are desperately hungry!

Humas Vs. Zombies is a game that takes part around an entire college campus. Where humans are given weapons (we have socks) and are able to "stun" zombies by hitting them with our socks. Our goal is to live for as long as possible. The zombies can only use their hands to "turn" humans into zombies. The 3 Redditors are the last of 15 Humans.
