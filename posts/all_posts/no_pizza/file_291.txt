I do freelance work online, but it isn't nearly enough to cover the bills. I rely on a local food bank (diabetes makes this difficult), and the assistance of my family. I'm looking for reliable work, but I live in a small town and I don't own a car; it makes things somewhat difficult. I've lived off of water and rice mixes for the last eight days, and could really go for a small pepperoni pizza. Nothing fancy; I'm a die-hard pepperoni fan.

Please message me, if you're feeling generous. There's a Papa Johns and a Pizza Hut within delivery distance, and a couple of Mom &amp; Pop places within a short walking distance.
