hi my names Alex ("Angel" to friends) i'm 23, just moved out of my house today because my roommates didn't want to pay their half of bills and in the process of going through my first eviction even though i was the responsible one. payed for myself to have a hotel for the week so i wasn't in the street (no family here and not wanting to go to a shelter) and realized there was no left over money for food.
i was talking with an old friend of mine and he said something about the site. i couldn't believe it lol kinda crazy when u think about it but i wanted to try it out and see if it was a real thing. So if there is a "Giver" who wouldn't mind, i would be more than appreciative,

                                                                   All my Sincerity,
                                                                              ANGEL &lt;3
