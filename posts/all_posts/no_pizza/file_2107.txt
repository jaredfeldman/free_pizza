I get paid once a month and I've just had a lot of unexpected surprises come forward. I'm in Austin, TX and just looking for something tonight. As stated, in exchange I will buy a pizza + extra appetizers or what have you next week as a token of thanks. I'd greatly appreciate it. I even tried rounding up pesos for pizza patron but mine are all Chilean :(

I'll answer any other questions or offer proof if you need.
