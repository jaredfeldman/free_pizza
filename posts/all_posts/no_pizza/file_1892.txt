    I feel really down that it has come to this but, I have been out of work 3 weeks now and money is really scarce.  During this stressful time I wish to have a night of relaxing and a nice pizza.  The hunt for a new job has and still is quite challenging.  Food is pretty tight as well and I am waiting for my food stamp app to get accepted.  If you feel like helping you would be doing me a nice nice favor.
