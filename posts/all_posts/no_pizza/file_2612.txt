So I've been studying for a test all morning and FINALLY felt confident that I was going to get a good grade. So I get in my car to drive to class, get onto the highway, start going about 60MPH...and my front tire pops. 

I honestly do not know how I didn't get in an accident. It was really terrifying. So, now all of my money will be going towards buying new tires. I also missed my test :( 

I hate having a sob story but I would seriously love some pizza to celebrate not being injured/dead. Thanks for reading!
