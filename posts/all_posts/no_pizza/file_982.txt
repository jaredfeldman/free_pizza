My parents and I are on a gluten free diet (no flour/wheat - no pizza crust) and scraping toppings off just ain't my thing. Domino's is the only place in the area with a Gluten-free option, and it's pretty expensive. We would buy it ourselves, but our household is in a bit of a financial pickle. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks so much in advance!
