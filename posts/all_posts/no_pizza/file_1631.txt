Hello everyone! I'm usually a bit of a lurker on here but I decided to ask for some help today. My husband is feeling really depressed today, we both got laid of from work a few weeks ago and haven't started getting unemployment yet/found work...things have been very hard. We used what money we did have on bills and rent. We have run out of food in the house (today is the first time this has ever happened) and won't be able to get any until we can go to the food bank on Tuesday. I would love to be able to surprise my husband with some Pizza please. I know a treat like that and a funny movie will help make him feel better for at least a little bit. I will only be able to reply to pms sent before 4pm central time as I'm at the library (one of the bills we had to cut was internet, ugh).
