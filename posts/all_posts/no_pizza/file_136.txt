Please excuse me if I do anything wrong I'm new here and all the information in the sidebar just confused the hell out of me a bit

A bit about my situation well I am from the UK living at home with mother and brother. brothers company he works for has gone bust he has no money and mother is at step mothers caring for her and left little food in the house. I am a fairly young girl I don't work because I have social anxiety issues and my dad is retired gets very little money on pension from the state.

my brother and I usually eat noodles for dinner on the days my mum is away but he is an eating machine there are none left not sure what I am supposed to eat and a friend directed me here. feel slightly ashamed to have to resort to this though please don't take that the wrong way. any help kindly appreciated though definitely not expected

thanks for reading :)
