In between paychecks and no food left in the apt. I have been trying to ration the food I had left to last until next week. Turns out I miss calculated. I have been out of a job for about 2 months now and just got another one a couple weeks ago, my next paycheck should be enough to cover everything, but until then I'm flat broke and can't even afford the gas to put in my bike to get to work. A nice hot meal other than the ramen Ive been eating would be nice right now. Any help?
