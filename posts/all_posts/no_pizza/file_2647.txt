Hey guys, sorry to come in my first time with a really, really depressing post. I was actually introduced to this place a month or so ago and was planning on having my first entry be a 3-pizza giveaway once I got my financial aid in, but I could really use the tiniest bit of support right now.

I just got the news that my grandfather had his ventilator removed and normally I think I'd be fine with dealing with this, but I think it's because I'm by myself in my apartment (my friends all have plans) and most of my family is up in Jersey to say goodbye, I'm having a rough time. As I'm said, I'm new, and don't quite know how to verify this, but heck, I'll take some kind comments at the very least. Seems like a very loving subreddit, so I suppose I'm just looking for a support outlet somewhere.

Thanks, guys.

EDIT: Orlando, Florida. Sorry, forgot to put that in the title.
