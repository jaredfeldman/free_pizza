I'm having a really bad day. First off, it was 90 degrees and I was standing at a bus stop trying to get back to campus (I go to the University of Chicago). Suddenly, two guys come up and grab my bag and run off. I spend the next couple of hours with police officers trying to find my bag which has my phone, a dress that I bought for my cousin's wedding, and a ball of yarn. I'm really bummed and would love nothing more than a pizza to end my bad day on a better note.
