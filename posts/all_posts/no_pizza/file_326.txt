I've been left at home all day in order to study for my Trial HSC (end of my last year of school before Uni), and I've found myself with a severe lack of food!

I know it's not the most urgent request, but a pizza would just be absolutely amazing right now, Reddit &lt;3

If it's not possible because I live in Australia, just tell me :P
