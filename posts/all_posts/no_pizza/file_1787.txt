Left my job last month due to anxiety issues and depression. Money has last a bit but the last bit is about to disappear. Partner is also off work due to illness and has been in and out of hospital and doctors offices for months.

Don't have anything in for dinner and just thought I would try and see if it was possible to get a little pizza please.

I haven't used this subreddit before I will be honest. I did give a guy portal 2 back in March though! Haha I don't know. 

Hopefully I will get a job and return the pizza favour!
