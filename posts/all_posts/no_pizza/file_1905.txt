Two of my four kids play sports and  on two nights of the week they both have practices at the same time in different towns. My husband takes one to Soccer and I take the other to Softball. After that we head home for a fast dinner before baths and bed. Tomorrow night it's suppose to be bean and cheese burritos as we are trying to stretch our food budget, not my favorite thing. A pizza would sure be great but cash is low until next payday. Would love to find a pizza hero for the night. We have lots of choices nearby, Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns and Round Table.
Thanks!
