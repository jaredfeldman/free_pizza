I'm an educator who is also a student.  I'm usually the one to help others out when they are in need.  But now I find myself who is the one in need.  After paying the mortgage, and the Phone bill and the light bill I found myself not able to pay for or buy any food for myself.  That was all most two weeks ago.  A friend of mine told me about this website so hear I am.  I hope that some one see's this post and is kind enough to help some one like me out with a pizza. 

I'm in Conyers, GA
