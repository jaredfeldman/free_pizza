So lately I have been having a hard time buying quality food, often times just eating a one bowl of cereal or spagettio's a day. I am getting tired of eating microwaveable/easy foods so I figured I would turn to reddit for some help! 
It would be greatly appreciated if someone sent an extra pizza my way, and the best part about pizza is that I could always save more for later!!!
Thank you ahead of time for any offers!
