Ok, first of all, I just made this account, A really good friend of mine suggested that I might be able to find some help out today.  i'm 4 hours away from my wife and daughter, because of my job.  I don't get paid any kind of money until tomorrow.  I Would love to have a pizza, I'm in a place i don't know anyway, and i'm only here for work.  I work outside all day long, and i'm starving!  if someone could help me out, I will gladly return the favor when i get my paycheck.  i'm just tryin to get some help today. thanks so much!
