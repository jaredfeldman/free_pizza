I have food in my house, just not much, or a decent variety. I've been having English muffins/buttered toast, and pasta with Alfredo sauce for the last few days, and there isn't much else to eat. I'd really just like to have a pizza for dinner. :) If you can think of any kind of (free) digital gift I could give you (something bitchin' on Photoshop, for example, or maybe some photos of my puppies), let me know, it'd be the least I could do.

Thanks in advance!
