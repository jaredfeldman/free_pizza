I had a small service going and I would just charge people in paypal for those services. A few weeks later I found out that about half of them end up charging back even though they were all "satisfied" with my services. 

Now paypal just calls me and I really don't know what to say. I don't have money to negate my - balance and could use a pizza to cheer me up. 

Here's a picture of my balance:

It was actually 100 something but I manage to win one dispute was too late to reply to another because I didn't check my paypal.
