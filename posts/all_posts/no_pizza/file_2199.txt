i literally have been eating rice with sriracha (nothing else in the fridge) for the past few days, hoping for some pizza to switch it up (and i guess to restore some of my strained faith in humanity? ...i suppose?) 

:/ 

long story short: went back to school and had to work shitty retail gig part time, barely making ends. now outta cash, but just started sweet new job. kind of getting by, barely, due to great friends.

 i think this is a nice idea, i'd definitely pay it forward when i get paid. Ask when you need, give when you can...right? Thanks if you can, no worries if you can't :)

(throwaway account btw)

EDIT: Forgot to say in Toronto
