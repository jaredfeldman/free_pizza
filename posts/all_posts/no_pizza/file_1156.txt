I'll keep this short and simple.        

The only food I have until Saturday or Sunday is eggs and some crackers. A pizza would feed me until Thursday or Friday, and I can deal with eggs and crackers until I can get some Ramen and other cheap food-stuffs this weekend.    

My money situation is about as crappy as it can possibly be, but I will buy someone a fat, loaded pizza as soon as I'm able, I promise. I love this subreddit and what it's all about.
