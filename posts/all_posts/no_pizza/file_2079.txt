The electric company turned off my power last night, I payed the bill, with what money I had left, but they said they won't turn it on until monday. I have little food, and what I do have is freezer stuff that I can't cook. I have two long papers to write for class and I'm pretty much running on empty and can't concentrate. What's a girl gotta do to get some pizza =\. This post honestly makes me feel so pathetic, took a lot of courage to finally post it, not a fan of asking for help.

It would really help if someone could send me an egift card or something, then when im back on my feet ill payt forward as much as i can.
