Ugh, so woke up 2 days ago to my 9 year old puking with a fever turned out she ha a UTI. Much fun as last time she had one we ended up in hospital as she was hallucinating through the fever.
We've broken through the fever and shes on the mend again now so good to see her smile shes requesting all her favourite foods as shes obviously not eaten properly all weekend and I'd love to supply her with a pizza.
