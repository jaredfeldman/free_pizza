After getting what had to be hundreds of "We're sorry" letters (and that's only the places that bothered to reply) I've finally run the gamut of interviews and got an offer!  I've been stretching my pennies quite far throughout this process, but the job is in another part of the country and I need to make sure I have enough scratch to make the trip.  

I'd love to be able to celebrate a bit and have some tasty pizza, and I look forward to being able to pay it forward before the end of the month. (I start the 22nd)

I have the big three close to me, and anything would make me so grateful!  Thanks for reading, and good luck to other job-seekers out there - it can seem like it's futile, but just keep at it!
