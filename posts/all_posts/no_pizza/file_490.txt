I run a struggling small business in southwest Ohio. Things aren't going so well, but I'm pretty certain once I get a nice clientele they'll ease up.

I live in an apartment with my girlfriend... between the two of us we struggle to pay for food, and suddenly I have a terrible cold (my fever just broke 100 degrees, and I've had fluid in my lungs a couple times... hoping it's not walking pneumonia), meaning working is impossible for me.

On top of that, just before the cold we had a condom break on us, so the money that would have gone to a copay to the doctor's office instead went to buying a morning after pill. I seriously hope it works. We've been trying to get regular birth control for *months,* but all we seem to do is struggle with the insurance company.

Just a little good news would be nice. Even if it's just "yes I'll buy you a pizza."

EDIT: I don't have much to offer, but my girlfriend can probably sketch you a little something if you want!
