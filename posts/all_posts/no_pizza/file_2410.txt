No big sob story.  Actually kept going back and forth to even post this.  Long story short, broke till payday, need some lunch.  Once I decided I will definitely pay it forward when I get paid, I figured what could it hurt.  Also seems to be a really fun concept to be a part of.  

In closing, thanks.  As stated, I will be back at the end of the week to pay it forward to others.
