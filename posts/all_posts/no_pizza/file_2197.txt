Hey RAOP, I'm chilling here in my dorm room and could use a great hot pie. I managed to land myself in a "suitcase university"--almost everyone goes home on the weekends. It's pretty lonely here. I have gifted before and would really appreciate some pizza. I absolutely LOVE Casey's pizza, but that's a midwest thing. Otherwise we have Pizza Hut close, and I'm not sure what else. 

Thanks a million for reading.
