Hey guys so my Jetta's engine light came on today and I can't get my car into the shop until tomorrow. My roomie and I meant to go grocery shopping today, but now that I'm carless we don't have a way to get there :( If anyone has a a coupon to a dominoes or any other pizza place we would really appreciate it if someone sent a pizza our way! I would normally just buy the pizza, but I'm going to need all the money I can get to fix this bitch. I feel bad if someone has to buy a pizza, so if someone has a free pizza coupon please send a PM my way and we will forever be in debt to you :)

TL;DR: Two college students in Arizona are starving and without a car. Looking for a free pizza coupon if they exist!

P.S. I can post a picture of my cars engine light at request.
