Hey!
I'm new to this site and this RAOP thing, but it is an awesome idea and it would be soooo awesome if someone out there would get me a pizza!

I would share the pizza with any of my friends who come over, so you would be feeding atleast 3 or 4 broke college students!

My account is new, so if anyone needs any verification or what not I would be more than happy to provide it!

Thank you soo much to anyone that helps, my buddies and I would appreciate it a ton!

BTW I live in Dallas and its wayyyyy to scorching hot to venture outside and walk to somewhere with a dollar menu!
