A friend of mine is feeling depressed. Unfortunately, I'm a few states away, so I can't offer hugs. I thought of the next best thing: Get them a pizza!

I know, I know...Get it yourself. Thing is, both of us are on government benefits. Guess what they don't cover? (If you answered "Cooked pizza", you'd be right! They actually don't cover hot foods period.) So, since my electronic money supply is short (paypal is at $0.00, specifically) and I don't have a credit card, I decided I'd check here. Help?
