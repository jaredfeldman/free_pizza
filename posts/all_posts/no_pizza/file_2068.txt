I'm swimming in student debt from my bachelor's degree while working on a master's degree. I live in a neighborhood many pizza delivery places won't go to, and if they do they don't come out of their car and you have to go out to them. I would love a pizza, or a gift card so I could pick up a pizza on my way home from my job. I just recently started making too much to qualify for food stamps anymore, but just barely. My food budget is tight, and things like pizzeria pizza are usually not an option.
