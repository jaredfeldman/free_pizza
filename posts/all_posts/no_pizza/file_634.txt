So yeah, poor kid just trying to get some food, no sob story here. And there is food at home, but it's just sweet stuff, like doritos and oreos. Well maybe there is a sob story. My ex gf left me after two years, and i've been trying to cope with this, but wasted all my money on liquor, and a massage(lol) after finding out she is seeing someone else already .. after two weeks. If anything would like to help, I appreciate it, i'm from New York City. I'll do anything. I just lurk btw, trees, leagueoflegends and depression.
