As of last month we went from having three jobs between us to just one. But between my remaining job and her unemployment checks we're not doing too bad considering, but having just payed the rent on the 3rd, we're completely tapped out. Her check should come tomorrow and I'll get paid on Friday, but we need to eat today. Would any random stranger be willing to help us out? I don't want to be a charity case so, I'd even be willing to pay you back when we get our money or pizza it forward. Thanks for reading!

**UPDATE**: SpeakerCity was kind enough to help a brother out! My pizza is already on the way. Thank you for offering, Lakerz4life and IrritableOwlSyndrome, too.
