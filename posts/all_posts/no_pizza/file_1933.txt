Just got out of the hospital, not anything major but I was there overnight.  My roommate left to work out of state this morning (left me an empty pantry and fridge), and the few friends I have here are busy.  Parents are 2.5 hours away and that's way too long to wait for food.  Can Reddit help me out?
