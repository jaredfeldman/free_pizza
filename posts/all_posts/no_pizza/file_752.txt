I've heard a lot about this subreddit from /r/trees and /r/assistance, but I have been relatively lucky up until now. I'm reaching out to this community! We're going to be a bit short for the next few days until I get paid again, and our pantry is bare and sorrowful. 

If you want verification, just let me know! I'll be happy to provide pictures or an email verification.
