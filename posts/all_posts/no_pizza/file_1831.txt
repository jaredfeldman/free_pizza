(I will write you a poem/haiku about whatever you want for a pizza.)

I got up hungry    
Because my roommate is cheap    
Pasta is not good    

My roommate and I take turns doing the grocery shopping, and this past week he ended up going. He brought back two cases of ramen, a 12 pack, and smokes. The 12 pack he downed himself the first night, his cigs are gone, and we are left with these little nasty packages of ramen. Sad part is, the receipt didn't add up to what I originally gave him. Can someone out there help two friends out with a meal that isn't soggy noodles? If you help us, your haiku will be posted for all to see. We will also supply [pictures](http://i.imgur.com/b0VNB.jpg), as that's just how we roll =)
