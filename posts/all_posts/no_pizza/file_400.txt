[Charlie Boy](http://imgur.com/ahS6V) here decided not to pay up when finished with one of the local cat prostitutes, so the neighborhood pimp cat had to get involved. He put up a fight but was left with some gnarly battle scars. Maybe with the money I save I could afford to get him a kitty eye patch. To be honest though I've been out of work for a good three months and would love something other than ramen noodles tonight. (Broke college student). Much appreciated!
