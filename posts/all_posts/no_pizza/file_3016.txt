I waited for four and a half hours at the ER two days ago for a friend with alcohol poisoning to wake up. Said friend was ungrateful that I brought here there and has thusly ditched me. That being said, the ER gave me some weird chest funk and I can't talk and can barely breathe since I'm coughing so frequently. I also happen to be starving and can't leave my dorm building to get food. I'll pay it forward as soon as I have a voice to order a pizza with.
