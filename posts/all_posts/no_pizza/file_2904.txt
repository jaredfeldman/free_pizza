I'm an american archaeology student working abroad in the UK. I don't get paid for a couple more days and I'd like to avoid eating boiled potatoes on their own. Sweet pizza has not passed my lips in over half a year. Can you imagine?

I'm willing to do what I can in return (proofread an anthro related paper? photograph me cutting and consuming pizza with my trowel, while wearing dig clothes perhaps? Salacious pictures of my moobs?) If you've got other ideas shoot them at me.
