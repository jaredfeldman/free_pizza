I will be at the WOW hall booth at the U of O Street Faire from 3:30 PM to 5:00. If you could just give the pizza company your number, I don't have a phone. My name is Andrew aka Rev. Andy, and you can hear me on OPB here: http://www.opb.org/thinkoutloud/shows/ross-brothers/ If possible a Meat Lover's deep dish with garlic and artichokes would be awesome, otherwise anything is cool! I won't be able to check back in after I get offline in a bit here, but please let me know if anyone can help!
