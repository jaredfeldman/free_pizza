Like the title says, I'm a poor college student practically starving. I've been eating some bootlegged Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal for about 5 days now, 3 times a day. Just today, I filled up what would be my last bowl to be ready to end the day. Of course, something happened, I found a beetle on my cereal, I had taken multiple spoonfuls at this point and didn't notice it. Did I mention I was terrified and grossed out of bugs? My only option was to through out the cereal, it took me some guts to even drink the milk at the end. (Didn't want to waste it) I live with my parents, and I have to drive a 1989 Lincoln Town Car to college every day. I can barely afford to pay for the gas every 5 days to go to and from school. All in all I'm starving, trying to finish my homework for the day. Some pizza would be awesome at this point.
