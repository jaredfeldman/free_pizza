hey! so i'm hoping someone can help this college student from the north shore of Massachusetts that just returned home to a family with far greater concerns than sticking pizza down my throat. I'm looking for jobs but no luck, per usual, and i'm hoping someone on here is willing to give me something to put in the win column seeing as it's been a while since I've been able to do so.

My email is 5yardfacemask@gmail.com

Thanks for existing everyone that is in this community :)
