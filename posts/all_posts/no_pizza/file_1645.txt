First time caller, long time listener. Hurricane Irene laid down some serious butt-hurt in good old colonial Williamsburg: A tree fell on our friends house, our basement flooded, and best of all, we've been without power since Saturday, and the electric company says it'll probably be back on... by Friday. So we basically had to cook all our room temperature meat that was in the freezer and hand it out to friends. Now we have no food, no power, and can't afford to eat out for every meal. We're just some poor college guys in a shitty situation, and could really use a RAoP.
