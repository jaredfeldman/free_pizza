My girlfriend usually stays home during the semester because it's closer to the college.  Most of the time she otherwise lives with me.  We are both in our mid-twenties. This evening, she was home, and her mom decides to do yet another psycho-parent sniff test disguised as a hug.  Convinced she smells "cigarettes or pot" (and obviously doesn't know the difference) on her adult daughter, she goes on a baseless accusatory my-house-my-rules rager.  She lives an hour away but decided she'd just rather live with me than suffer through that again.  We're saving up to move away to Colorado, and we'd really love to just chill out and eat some pizza tonight.  Domino's is the only thing around; if anyone wants to help, we would definitely pay it forward in the future.  I'd love to be able to surprise her with not having to cook dinner when she gets here.  Thank you.
