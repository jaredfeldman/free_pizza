Crazy, but true. I'm stuck in the Houston, Texas area, waiting for money to hit my account again. In the meantime, this old friend, who I now can only pity, played the friendship card to feed his habit, then ran. I would so LOVE a pizza right now. Pizza can make the world right again. 

thank you!!!
