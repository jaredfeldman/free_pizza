I'm craving pizza something fierce and only have money in my paypal at the moment. After looking around online, I can't seem to find anywhere that accepts paypal as a payment option. 

Anyway, if anyone can give me information to order with paypal or maybe if i could pay someone with paypal to order for me it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!
