Lost my job on Monday and after my beginning of month bills were paid I'm completely broke until Friday when my final paycheck will come in.

Omaha, NE, there is a Pizza Hut and a Godfather's Pizza nearby that deliver. I believe there should also probably be a Papa Johns as well somewhere nearby that would deliver here.
