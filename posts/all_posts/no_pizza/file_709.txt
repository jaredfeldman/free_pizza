My girlfriend and I are both recent college graduates, and while my career is in very high demand (and I had no trouble finding a job), she's been struggling these last six months trying to make contacts and get her foot in the door. Unfortunately, education is taking a pounding in this economy and she has her degree in K-12 Art Education, in New Jersey. 

In the short amount of time my girlfriend doesn't spend subbing or working at her near minimum-wage job to barely make ends meet, she's cold-calling school districts and putting out resumes left and right. It would be one thing if she wasn't trying, but it pains me to see my girlfriend put in all this effort and have nothing pay off.

I would love to be able to surprise my girlfriend with some new teaching contacts, or some new leads or even some ideas of other jobs that could utilize her degree and background until a position comes up. 

I feel awkward writing this, but please, I am NOT looking for money. While I would appreciate the gesture there are more deserving posts here that could use monetary assistance. I just know how powerful and far the reach of Reddit goes, and know that everyone loves to help a guy with a novelty throwaway account! Thanks for any and all help.
