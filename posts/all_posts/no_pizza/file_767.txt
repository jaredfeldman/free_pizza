I am almost completely out of food and have a negative balance in my account at present. I am unemployed and my unemployment insurance is expiring.  I could really use a cheering up in the form of a decent meal if anyone is feeling generous.  I would gladly repay the kindness by paying it forward when I get back to work.  

If anyone wants more information about my situation or any proof I am able to provide please PM me.  I have a verification system code available as well, please ask if you need it.

Thanks in advance to anyone considering helping me out.
