My unemployment benefits have been exhausted and my interview for food stamps isn't until Tuesday. The only food I have at home is bread and peanut butter that I've been eating all week..I would love a pizza.. I will provide anyone willing with verification of who I am and even screenshots and pictures. I would greatly appreciate any help and thank you in advance!
