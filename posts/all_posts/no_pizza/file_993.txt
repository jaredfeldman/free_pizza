I've been near broke since late May and for the past 2 weeks I've been scraping by on my loose change while I wait for the first paycheck from a new job. I was told I would be receiving direct deposit by midnight of last night and I woke up this morning to... nothing. Lately I've been eating rice, .50 loaves of day old Jimmy Johns bread, and $2 lunch specials from this really great Thai restaurant nearby. But those can get pretty tiring after repetition.  

I have just enough change to take the CTA to and from work for today and tomorrow and if don't get my money by then, well fuck, that's my own problem. I have $5.90 left in my bank account, which I'm keeping there as a kind of emergency buffer. Here's screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/w1Rs7.png

Anyone there able to help a hungry redditor out?
