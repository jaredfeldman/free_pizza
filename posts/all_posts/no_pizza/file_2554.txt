Hi Reddit,

Before you all jump on me for being a new member, I hope you will take the chance to read my plea.  Yes, I'm new to the community, no I didn't hear about it through the news reports the other day, but rather heard about it from a family friend.  

In the past month, my life has essentially fallen apart.  My wife of 15 years has all but thrown in the towel to our marriage.  She has moved back in with her parents, and I'm living in our house with our two children, Jennifer &amp; William.  Along with this added stress, I've just lost my job as a management consultant.  So now I'm left with a broken heart, a hole in my pocket and two hungry kids to feed.

We're not in as terrible of a position as other members on here, but I was wondering if a kind member would be willing to donate a pizza so I can surprise my kids at some point, and hopefully help them get their minds off our current situation. 

Thank you all so much for even reading this.
