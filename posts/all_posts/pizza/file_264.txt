I'm currently dogsitting for a close friend. They were supposed to be home an hour ago, but I just got called and they have apologised and said they won't be back for about another 12 hours. They did say I could help myself to what was in the fridge, so I had a look and, and [this](http://imgur.com/vKTKU) was the sum total - 1 tub of butter, 1 tub of margerine, a tray of expired eggs, some wine, some flat pepsi, some stale milk and a bottle of lemonade. I'm so hungry right now it's unreal, and I will happily pay this forward when I get back home tonight.
