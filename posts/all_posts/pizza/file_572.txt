Throwaway for obvious reasons. So, I finally got a job!!! I really want to celebrate with my friends and keep my spirits up. I would love whoever could hook us up with a pizza please. I start on Monday and won't get my first check for at least 3 weeks. 

I've been so down in the dumps wondering where my next meal would come from or how I would even get it. I've come from having a furnished living space to bare walls and a dream of being able to support myself again. I thought about committing suicide because I just couldn't see any end in sight to this. 

I want to thank my friends who stood by me and helped me in my search. A pizza can't repay them for all they've done, but it's definitely a start. If you're in the Santa Fe area, you are more than welcomed to join us. I hope someone can help me do something nice for my friends. Thank you.
