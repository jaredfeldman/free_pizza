So, I'm hungry, and I want pizza (I'm in Texas).  But I'd really like to trade you for it!

I have a REALLY cute dog (a Chihuahua, but not the kind that can be mistaken for a rat) and I have some pretty cute pictures of her that I'll "trade" for some pizza.  You can talk with PastafarianTwit if you need verification that she's cute!  :)

PLUS, to sweeten the deal, I'll post a Thank you, with some pics of pizza and puppy, so everyone can enjoy!  :)

I'll be in the chat room and lurking here if you'd like to set up the deal.  And gosh, this sounds like I'm trying to trade drugs, but no, only cute puppy pictures for nom-able pizza. :)

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: DrinkNDerive can also independently confirm that the pics I have to offer are top-grade cute.

EDIT the 2nd: I got too hungry, with no responses, so I ordered on my own.  Still, if you'd like to still trade for a gift-card for future pizza, PM me and we'll work something out.  :)
