hello all,

I am a 24 year old guy who just graduated from university. I have a job, but with rent/bills I have no funds until I get paid on Wednesday. I have been eating beans and rice which is not so bad, but its starting to taste like mush. if anyone could help out, id be sure to pay it forward in the near future. 

thanks!
