I am a nineteen year old Western student who finally got part time at a sushi restaurant. I make about thirty dollars more than rent per month. Some variety from the ramen would be great, I've lost quite a bit of weight since moving out and can't exercise or smoke chronic anymore because of the food costs. I am eternally grateful, will pay it forward of course.
