Just spent almost $1600 on my car to get it through emissions in order to renew the registration, which expired yesterday and also replace the waterpump which went at the same time. Still need to wait until my next paycheck in order to afford to pay this year's car taxes and the renewal fee. I had to borrow money and use all of my check in order to cover it so far.

But the good news is, not only did I get a promotion at my full time job, I was also hired as a freelance on call artist for MAC Cosmetics, which pays MUCH more than what I earn at my full time job. Hopefully within the next two or three months I'll be in a place where I don't feel like I have to ask the internet for food and I can give away pizza like woah.

So this is kind of a desperately hungry/celebration pizza!

There's a Pizza Hut and Dominos that both deliver near me. I'd seriously be grateful. Thanks!
