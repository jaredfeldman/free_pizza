Hey there pizzaland! Pizza would be pretty awesome right now. Definitely don't need it, not starving or anything, but a nice pie is always tasty and would be a welcome treat from all the sandwiches I've been surviving on. I'm currently saving up all my money until after next pay day so I can go see my BFF graduate bootcamp in San Diego. I've been scrimping and saving to make this happen, so unfortunately pizza is just not in the budget right now.  

If anyone would make my night and send me a pizza pie - that would put me over the moon. I'll definitely return the deed in a few weeks once I have some extra spending money (august 9th).

May the pizza deities guide and protect you.
