Got booted out of the military several months ago due to downsizing and been waiting on this new job since then. I got it, just waiting for the spot to open and hopefully it's within the week. All our savings are gone and barely subsisting in this 1k rent apartment, cost of living is ridiculous and I can't move cause i'm getting the job anyday. Borrowing from family to make the bills and ramen and other asian staples are managing to get me and my wife by. Just a little something to cheer her and the baby up would be nice. Not used to asking for stuff just I'm pretty sure she's tired of rice and soup. verification code, also new to this so I don't know the procedure pm me.
