So we're waiting out for some money so we can get moved, but today my husband got his GED after three years! I'm so proud of him and he doesn't think it's anything special, but I want to reward him. Problem is we're pretty tight for cash after enrolling in college [waiting on loans, yay debt!]. If anyone would be so kind, it would really mean a lot to us.

Also just thanks for having such a nice subreddit for people. It's good to know people are getting help. :D
