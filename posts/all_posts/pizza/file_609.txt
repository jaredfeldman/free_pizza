I'm a 22 year old guy living in the outskirts of Seattle. I lost my job a couple months ago because of anxiety issues and have been barely making it by. I'm practically down to my last packet of ramen. =(

I have an exciting job opportunity now, and if everything goes well, I should be starting next week! I'll dedicate my first pay-check to you guys and offer someone else in need a free pizza!
Please help me out, reddit! =)
