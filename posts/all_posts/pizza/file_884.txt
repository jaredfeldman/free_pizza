im a rugby player, and im due to start my last season for my college team in a month. sprained my ankle in july playing soccer, just got an MRI due to the persistant pain, and found out i shredded a ligament. its possibly surgical, and when i told my new boss, he said hed have to let me go because im on crutches and im 'a risky investment.' i had just paid my rent with the last of my savings yesterday before my doctors appointment, and i have $10 till tuesday [also my birthday]. just a little bummed and hungry--id really appreciate a meal, and id be happy to provide any sort of verification needed. thanks for reading.
