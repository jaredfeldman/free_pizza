My brother and I are both broke, unemployed USMC veterans who are trying to find jobs for the summer in between college semesters (Good news! We have interviews with the same business tomorrow afternoon.) We've both been working odd jobs during the graveyard shift, so we're up all night and sleep during the mid-morning/early afternoon. We've been spacing out the few dollars we had for ramen noodles, but even our change jars are empty now. Since we haven't eaten since Saturday, a pizza would be the best thing ever. Plus, I'm sure we could make it last a couple days. I will absolutely pay it forward once we get some money coming in.
