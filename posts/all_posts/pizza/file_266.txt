Hey reddit,

I've really hit some hard times recently, lost my job, kicked out of my apartment, car broke down. Pretty much anything bad you could imagine going bad in one's life, it has happened to me.

All my family is in Colorado, so moving out there is pretty much out of the questions. So right now I'm crashing on my buddies couch, but I'm not sure how long that will last or how long until he loses his mind and kicks me out.

I would love to be able to pay him back someway or another, and pizza popped into my mind. Being as it is a Friday night, and I don't have the fund to do much anything but breathe and drink free water, I'm not going out tonight. Anyone have it in their heart to help out a fellow human being whose life has hit the skids?
