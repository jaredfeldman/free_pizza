I spend my days making magic for little kids at DisneyQuest. Between car payments and housing, I'm at about 48cents in my back account right now. I'm hungry and just got home from a nice 10-hour shift and I was hoping someone out there would be willing to feed me. I'll return the favor or pay it forward anyway I possibly can. Any redditor in the Orlando area wanna get into Disney for free? I'll hook you up. :]
