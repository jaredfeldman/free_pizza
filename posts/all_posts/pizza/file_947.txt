just a guy out of money after Christmas shopping for may family. no money left in my bank and credit card is maxed. i got paid last tues and had to go Christmas shopping be for me and my sister (we share an apartment) have to drive to Maine to see our parents for Christmas. i would really be thankful and be in dept to RAOP. me and an IRL friend have always wanted to help someone out on here and i never got the chance but next month is going to be great (huge work bonus) and i plan to give at least two pizza's if not more. but if you could help my sister and I, it would be awesome!

anyway thanks for reading reddit!
