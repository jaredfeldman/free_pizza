Having a rough night dealing with a good amount of things. Can't really manage cooking for myself, and don't have much of an appetite but need to force myself to eat something. Anyone help a girl out?

I could manage more details, but I'd rather not go into much. Mostly stress from dealing with legal stuff with my abusive ex and my son and trying non-stop to find myself a job with no avail.

Broke, obviously, but will pay it forward as soon as I can. Only have dominos in my area...thanks.
