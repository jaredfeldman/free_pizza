That's right! I'm finally employed. After being poor for almost a full year, I am now capable of actually buying things! Except not yet. My first paycheck was to be today, but an error occurred with the direct deposits and so I have to wait for the check to come in the mail now. I'm not a sob story in need of something to eat, but i am hungry and would love a stuffed crust pizza or something. Please and thank you!
