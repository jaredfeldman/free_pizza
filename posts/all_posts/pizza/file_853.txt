My father used to order my mother a pepperoni pizza and an order of breadsticks for the two of them to share (My younger brother and I would have our own). He included a special request to have the pepperonis arranged in a smile and would personally place 2 breadsticks on the pizza to give it a mustache. 

This always put a smile on her face. My younger brother has autism and my mother has Multiple Sclerosis but has still been working her ass of through the pain.

She lost her job at the end of last August and a month later my father passed away. I just got off the phone with her and she was holding back tears. I really want to make her smile by bringing back some of the good memories of my father and reminding her that there is good in the world.

I do not have a credit card and only have $4 in my bank. I would really like to send her a smiley-face pizza. Can anyone help me put a smile on the most wonderful woman in the world's face?

I promise to pay it forward as soon as I have the funds.
