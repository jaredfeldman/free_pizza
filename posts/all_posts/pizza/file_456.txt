My birthday is on July 4th and I was wondering if anyone would be so kind as to get me something to eat. I'm turning 19 this year! Please NO DOMINOS! I recently quit my job there and i would rather not see anyone that works there for a while.

I live 5 minutes away from East Lansing, MI (Close to Michigan State University)
