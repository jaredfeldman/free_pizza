I have never really been one to ask for help, but my kids over rule my pride any day.
I am the proud mother of four beautiful children:
Aiden: 2
Cameron: 3
Olivia: 5
Joshua; 8
Recently we've had some bad times, my husband of 10 years kicked me and my children out after meeting a girl online, I have no family here and I don't really know anyone but the people I go to church with. My father is helping me out all he can he's paying for my room. I haven't had a job in 8 year but now I'm looking but there are very few jobs and I have to work around the churches day-care program I am food stamps Wednesday and the motel offers a free breakfast, but my children really deserve a pizza I mean their lives are completely changed and while their friends are going to see Harry Potter(mostly Josh) I can't afford anything like that's and I am Hoping maybe I can get some pizza to boost morale.
