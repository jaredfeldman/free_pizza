Title says it. I'm bummed. I'm in the midst of an internship with disney (you would think I'd make money to live on). I had a seizure the other week so I've been out of work for awhile, my roommates have been awful, I've been dealing with security all day and I would love to just relax with a pizza and a movie and chill. I can't afford my own pizza right now. Bummer. 

So does someone want to make my night?
