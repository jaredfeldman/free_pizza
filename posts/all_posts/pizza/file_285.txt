Hi, I am a married college student with no job or income, my wife doesn't have one either. Right now we have about 40 bucks to spend for the rest of the month until we get our school financial aid in the last week of August.

As I mentioned before it was my birthday a few days ago and no one bought me pizza :( sad day. On top of that I just went to go get the cheesecake my wife made for me for my birthday and someone ate it before I could. We are living with her parents at the moment because it is close to the school we both attend, but we recently moved here and haven't been able to find jobs yet, the only money we have been living on is the left over financial aid from last spring semester.

We can make it the rest of the month food wise, but not pizza wise. Without Pizza how will we survive?

EDIT: Location is around Sacramento California. 

Also our favorite type of Pizza is a deal from Papa Johns we regularly get when we have money that costs around 15-20 bucks. I can't remember the exact price.
