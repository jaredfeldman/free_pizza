My 6 year old autistic son, and my 4 year old daughter are finally back in our home after along battle with social services, the problem is that right now we have 5 more days until our food assistance kicks in for the month, and we don't have much of anything to eat. we could really use a helping hand for them, their mom, grandmother, and myself. I feel worse, because I turn 36 in 8 days, and haven't worked in a few years. between the out of work situation, and dealing with both kids disablilities, you can only imagine the stress. My entire family would be so grateful for any help we could get. thanx to anyone willing to help.
