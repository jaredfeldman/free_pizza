Hey, I don't normally do this kind of thing, but it would really help me right now. I have found myself to be recently homeless with no food or money, and being that I am hypoglycemic, I probably should do something about it. If anyone could send me a pizza, I could make it last me several days and it would keep my glucose levels at least somewhat stable. This is a temporary situation and I intend to get back onto my feet, but for now I am in need of any kind of help I can get. I would greatly appreciate it.
