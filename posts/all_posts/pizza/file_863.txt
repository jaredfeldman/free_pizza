It's my birthday, and I'm spending it hungry, alone, broke, amd homeless. I don't really want to ask for much, but I'm so hungry and I haven't eaten anything but dry cheerios for the past two days, and I just found out of this place. If anyone could help me, god, I would be so thanlful and appreciative. Anything I could do to return the favor or pay it forward, I swear I will do. Cause I mean, I know how it is, everyone has low points and needs help sometimes.
