My small family of myself, my wife, and our two kids are ecstatic today at having just landed a new job that has better pay, is a closer commute, and will finally have me working daytime hours so that I can spend more time with my family instead of *sleeping* while they're awake!

I'd love to get some pizza to celebrate with them, but our bank account currently says $0.42, which might afford me a pepperoni.  Anyone feeling like being a part of the celebration?
