After a lengthy conversation with my financial aid office, I have found out I will be receiving little to no benefit whatsoever from my school that aren't loans (this is actually a pretty big deal for me, personally) and for the summer I have no access to loans so I'm without any money after rent goes through. Some pizza would be **damn** good right about now. I'm in Irvine, CA if someone would be so kind :)
