My close uncle is in the hospital. I don't know the full details but he more or less lost his mind. For the past 3 weeks he has been making up strange stories that got more and more strange and the other day it got very bad and he passed out and has been in the hospital since. Tomorrow me and my fiancee are driving 220 miles to go visit him and the rest of my family and I am using the last of my money to do so. I am out of a job and so is she and we would both love to be able to just relax tonight with a nice pizza to help cheer us up. I promise to pay it forward as soon as I get a job or some extra money.

EDIT: Forgot to include our location. We live in Plymouth, Indiana.
