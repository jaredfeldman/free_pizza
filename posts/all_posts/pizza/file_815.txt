I can offer you my sob story, but I don't think that would be too appreciated, haha... So in short, my mom and I are both students, and completely broke. I work but get very few hours (overnights, and hours have been getting cut like crazy recently), and my mom is currently unemployed and has been trying really hard to find a steady job (her school schedule doesn't make it as easy as it had been before she went back).
More than willing to repay when I get my taxes in! Thanks :)
