Long story short, I'm unemployed and joining the army. Unfortunatly it's taking WAY longer than anticipated and in the meantime I have been unable to find any work.  
My girlfriend puts up with me and she's currently out now with her little part time retail job which she has to keep us scraping.  
I'd like to surprise her for when she comes in from work at 4pm with pizza (we haven't had any for a long time - training fitness etc etc)  

Since you got this far - Thanks for listening :)
