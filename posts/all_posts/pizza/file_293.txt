I got left behind this year.  My brother went to his friend's house.  My parents went to New York.  I was told my sister would be having a Thanksgiving dinner at her apartment, but that didn't happen.  So now it's just me and my dog with the house to ourselves.  I got some Hot Pockets in the freezer, but it seems kind of sad to eat that on Thanksgiving.  

Also, I guess I should include a location.  Santa Clarita, CA.
