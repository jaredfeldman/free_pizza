Trying to set up a surprise romantic evening for my hubby and I.  Only detail is that we are vegan, however there is a nice place close by that offers a large, 1 topping, for $10, that is made with vegan cheese and they have vegan toppings. I have all the other "components" for the evening ready to go, just need the pizza. Thanks in advance.

PS. I promise to post pics!
