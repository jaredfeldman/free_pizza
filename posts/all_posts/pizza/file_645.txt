So... I don't really know how to request pizza, especially since what I have to ask for probably makes me sound really... un-needy. I'm 24, flew myself out to Columbus Ohio to work with Cirque Du Soleil temporarily and only work four hours a day and we haven't gotten paid yet. I'm down to $100 and I use most of that to help get me to and from the Cirque site and I haven't eaten anything except some Bananas since yesterday. 

It's hard to ask for help, since I put myself here because I want to one day work for Cirque Du Soleil -- instead of just a temporary job working with a show while they are in a city. I plan on trying to follow them for a few more shows and hope the experience helps set my resume apart, as well as that I can practice some aerial arts (trapeze).

I absolutely love the show and the people I am following and it's really the show I want to work for but if I were to actually land a job with Cirque, I honestly would not mind any show.

Regardless, gluten makes me very sick so pizza typically isn't something I can get unless I order multiple little domino's gluten free pizza. I don't really know who else delivers in the downtown columbus area that has gluten free, and also since it's 1am.

I don't expect pizza, since GF is such a hassle but thank you for having a subreddit like this exist.
