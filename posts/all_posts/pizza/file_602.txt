About a month ago I lost my job and my wife and I were barely able to get by and we got a bit of help here and there from family and friends and a pizza from a great redditor.  Unfortunately things got worse.  I still havent found a job and three nights ago my wife moved out because "im not providing so why should I stay".  And while I know she has a point ive been left more or less crippled at home.  No job.  No money from no job.  No car now.  And she took the cat...  And ive spent the last moth sellung anything I can to make money.  Im at around -500 in my account because I overdrsfted to make my phone and lights stay on.  My phone is my only means of computing or communication I sold the cokputer.  Anyways I havent eaten in a few days and only vary sparingly before that and would just like a pizza to make me a little less depressed.  Any help would be greatly appreciated snd anything I can do back I would in aan instant.  Thank you
