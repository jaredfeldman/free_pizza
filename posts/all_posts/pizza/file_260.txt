I seriously love buffalo chicken pizza. Like, straight up addicted. There's a local pizzeria that delivers and they make the best buffalo chicken pizza I've ever had; however if you dont feel safe with that or have a Giftcard to a chain I could care less, I just want a buffalo chicken pizza soooo bad!
