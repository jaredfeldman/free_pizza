hi guys, earlier this week i tore or otherwise really messed up a tendon in my shoulder while at work. i just spent the last of my cash putting gas in my roommate's car so he can get to work. i'm down to chocolate milk, dry rice and canned peas until i get paid tomorrow (thursday) night and i'm in too much pain to even use my dominant hand to type, let alone use pots and pans and try to cook something that doesnt even seem worth eating to begin with. and of course a pay it forward or a thank you pizza for the donator will be the least i can do, guaranteed by end of day saturday.

i appreciate your time, this took me a long time to type with only my non-dominant hand &gt;.&lt;
