I am a nursing student in south eastern North Carolina. I am 29 years old, and I have 5 children. I was expecting to have my financial aid refund check this past week, but got an email last Wednesday that because I had a class that started late, I will not get my check until the middle of July. We budget very carefully to have money for everything, and this has really put us in a bind. We do get food stamps, but because they changed the date of disbursement for July, we've had to really stretch our food budget to make it through until then. We won't starve without pizza, but it would be nice to treat my kids, since I had promised them we would go out for a nice dinner when my check came. I can, and will help someone out in a few weeks when I get my refund. Thank you if anyone wants to help. :)
