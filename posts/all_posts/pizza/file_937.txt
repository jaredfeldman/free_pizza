There seem to be a lot of people on here more deserving than I am but I will give it a shot.  I'm a 24 year old public servant (Police/Fire Dispatcher) and my last check came up way short because of some unforeseen BS.  I've made it almost 2 weeks with 5 bucks but with 4 days left its run out and I've run out of ideas.  Any help would be appreciated.
