I have an awsome neighbor who's a single dad of 3 (under the age of 9) he lost his job 3 weeks ago.  I help him out when I can with food for the kids, but I'm a single mom myself, so I can't keep it up much longer. He's been eating Ramen noodles for the past 2 days, he's a great guy, going out there applying for jobs, unfortunately going through a rough time lately!! Please help lift his spirts! Thanks!!
