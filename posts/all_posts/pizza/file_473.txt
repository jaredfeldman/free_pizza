I just started one of those awesome jobs where you only get paid once a month. It's been a bitch not being able to claim unemployment the last few weeks and currently have [less than adequate funds.](http://i.imgur.com/ls8TW.jpg) Anyone willing to help a guy out? Pretty much been living on ramen and toaster shakens that last couple days.
