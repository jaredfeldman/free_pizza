We're completely broke and craving pizza. I thought I was super smart and ordered Domino's gift cards on Walmart.com with my Paypal - they aren't going to be e-delivered until tomorrow! Payday is Friday, and we don't have any money for groceries until then... but I will reciprocate! I will also send a homemade candle if someone wants... if you're kind enough to feed hubs and I, let me know if you'd like one, and I'll let you know the scents that we have available. 

Thank you!
