I've been pretty much struggling with money this year, my already small loan was reduced, the money I had saved from summer didn't go far as a lot of it had to step in to cover the shortfall in my rent and the part time job market sucks.

So toward the end of this year I've been selling stuff to make ends meet. I sold an effects pedal last week for £30 thinking I would budget £10 a week for food to last me.

Now I get an interview for a job back in my home town and I had to spend the next 2 weeks food money on tickets to go to it. I've got rice, butter and frozen peas, but I'd sure like something more substantial if a redditor was kind enough to help a brother out?
