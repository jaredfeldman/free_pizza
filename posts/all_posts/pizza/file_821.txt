Hey, thanks for reading this post. I'm a college student living in Hamilton ohio, I've just finished pulling my third all nighter for a final project in the last four days. I'm really hungry and would LOVE a pizza tonight since it seems I'll be up again. I would love an e-card to larosas, papa johns, or marcos, since those are the only places within a reasonable driving distance for me.  Again, thank you for reading this post, and REALLY thank you if someone decides to make my fourth all nighter a lot less depressing.
