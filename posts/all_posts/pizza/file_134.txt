me and my two roommates all work minimum wage jobs and pretty much live paycheck to paycheck, on Mondays our local Domino's (which is right next to our house) in St. John's, NL has 5$ pizzas and usually one of us have the money to get a couple of pies...we've all had a really hard week including a death in the family and flooding basements and we've all gotten the same flu so our checks have been short due to loss of hours; my roommate and I who are Reddit fanatics decided to come to you fine people with this simple request for a couple of 5$ monday medium pepperonis; and we promise to pay it forward to another redditor next week! thanks for listening
