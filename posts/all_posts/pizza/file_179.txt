WARNING: TL;DR


Hey, so after 4 years of knowing this person, I've finally asked out the woman of my dreams to a date this Tuesday, and I'm STOKED! Problem is...I am broke. I'm only in 10th grade and my parents aren't big on lending me money. That's a big downer. However a good buddy of mine has been a Redditor for some years now, and he said that what I should do is come here for random acts of pizza. Normally, being the internet, I'm unsure how this works or if the internet is a kind-hearted place or not. So...going on my friends word.. Can you guys help me with this date? I don't wanna lose her after the first date. Thanks Reddit!

[TL;DR] I have a first date with a 4 year crush in a few days and my friend reccomended me to ask here for the most romantic pizza dinner by Reddit.
