I feel kind of guilty asking this, because I'm usually the person helping out others, not the one looking for help. I just finished my summer term last night and wanted to celebrate somehow, and pizza is the go-to food for college students, right? Well, I wanted to order some Domino's last night for a night of PS3 fun but quickly realized it wasn't financially feasible at the time. In fact, I can't even get 10 bucks worth of gas right now to leave my apartment.

If you want, I can get screen shots of my grades to verify. And I **WILL** pay it forward when I get paid next month (my only income is from the GI Bill, as I am unemployed right now). I'll send you the link when I do and of course I will thank you on here, publicly.
