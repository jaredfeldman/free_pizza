On Sept 30th our baby boy Ezra was born and unexpectedly had a long NICU stay in a hospital over an hour away from our home... and that really drained our account.  We have two other kids, and my husband being out of work for so long while I stayed to breastfeed the new baby in the NICU unit made money even tighter, and on top of everything else, we got a SPEEDING TICKET heading to the hospital initially to have him, no joke!  He sure is cute though and worth ALL we went through a million times over: http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9149/ezra016.jpg

Today my husband texted me twice from work that he is depressed.  He totally forgot he missed his certification test (that we had to pay for!) this morning because he was doing his defensive driving course online for 6 hours and had too much on his mind.  Then his watch broke at work :(  He won't be home for another hour and I feel so bad for him, he is really feeling down on himself since we are so short on money and everything has gone so wrong.  A pizza would really cheer him (and our 2 toddlers!) up.  Even our German Shepherd would appreciate the scrap pizza crust - poor girl has been here by herself a lot lately. I would appreciate it SO much, and we would gladly post a picture upon receipt to show our appreciation.  We live in Texas, and Pizza Hut sounds HEAVINGLY.
