I am a single mother of 1 on disability and would love to treat my daughter with her favorite pizza. I am on disability and only have $40 to last us the rest of the month. We have been eating ramen noodles and very simple foods. I would love to be able to treat my daughter to her favorite pizza hut pizza but I am completly broke and need the $40 to last. This has too be used for gas and basic toiletries and food as well. I just found out about this site and think it is amazing that their are people out there willing to help complete strangers. Bless you all. I hope you can help. A pizza hut giftcard would really make her day. Will provide verification too. Thanks again!
