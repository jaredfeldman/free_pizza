My wife is in the hospital and along with the costs of her surgery (she injured her eye and jaw in a car accident), the stress this has been on my 7 year old girl and 5 year old boy is extraordinary. I haven't had time to get decent food for them and a pizza would...to be honest...a blessing. Life hasn't always been this hard on my family and I eagerly anticipate the day I can pay this forward.
