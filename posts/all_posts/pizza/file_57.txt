I've been awake for around 56 hours for a little experiment that I'm doing and a pizza would be so great. I'm not entirely in need and I'm not gonna starve to death or anything but I don't have any cash lying around to buy myself a pizza. I'm in Eastern Canada. If you guys don't feel like buying for me, at least go help someone else :) I'll pay it forward when I get the cash.
