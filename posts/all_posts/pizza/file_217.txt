I am a college student at oregon state university, and I am studying all day for my  finals this coming week. A hot pizza pie would make my day because there is no better food to study with. I do have some food in my fridge so I am in no way in danger of starving without this pizza, but it would brighten my otherwise dull next couple of days of pure study. I would be sure to pay it forward after my finals and when  I have extra cash I can spend.
