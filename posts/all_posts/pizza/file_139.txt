I hope it's okay to request on behalf of others. My friend in Aberystwyth has several thousand words to write tonight, but she's got no money, ran out of rice and lentils yesterday, and doesn't get her student loan until tomorrow.

I'd buy her something myself but I'm also out of money, and I live in Cardiff so I can't bring her food.

She'd be very grateful for a pizza, and I'll pay it forward when I can.
