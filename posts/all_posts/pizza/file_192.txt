My bank account is frozen due to 'suspicious activity' which is a mistake on the bank's part but they said there's nothing they can do for 5-6 days on top of that the electricity in my apartment just got turned back on due to a power line getting struck a few days ago and all of the food in my fridge is bad now. I was planning on shopping tonight but with my account frozen, I can't. 

I spent the last bit of money I had on-hand to buy my 4 and a half month old son some formula and put some gas into my car. A pizza would do wonders for me tonight. 

I'll gladly pay it forward when my bank account becomes unfrozen
