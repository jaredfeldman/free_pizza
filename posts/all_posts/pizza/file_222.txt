I ran out of money on my meal card a while back, and finished the last of my easymac/sandwich stuff yesterday. Luckily for me the term is almost over, so I only need to survive for another week. A pizza would really help lighten that burden, and I could stretch it out to last. If you send anything my way, I'd love to write you a song telling you how awesome you are and record it.

Edit: As far as my music, I do orchestral/soundtrack like stuff, and some folk and jazz.
