These are the reasons we NEED pizza:

1. One of our roommates is lost in a storm and we would like her to have some melty, tomatoey, cheesy goodness when (if) she survives and makes it back to our dorm.
2. One roommate is banging her head on her desk and if we had a pizza it would be a good cushion so she wouldn't hurt her head.
3. Our toes and fingers are cold and we could use the leftover pizza to warm them.
4. One roommate has an exam and is laughing hysterically. Probably to keep from crying. We think pizza would help.
5. This same roommate just announced that she had to fart. We need pizza aromas to cover up the smell of her toxic waste.
6. Lucy is lost.
7. We can't have our pet unicorn in the dorm, so we think pizza would be the next best thing to have (sloths aren't allowed, either).
8. I just needed to have one more reason so that our list would have an even number of reasons because odd numbers are gross.

Peace and blessins'
