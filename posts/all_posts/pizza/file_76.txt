Hey Redditors, I'll try and keep it short. I've been broke for quite some time with just enough money to pay for rent. I recently got a job, working I.T., but I wont see a check until the end of the month. My sob story isn't all that bad, i'm glad to finally have a job! I just don't have any money yet for any food.

I was just wondering if /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza would be willing to help me through this Saturday night.
