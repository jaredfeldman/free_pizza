I've never done this before, but figured as it's Christmas there may be a kind soul out there who would like to buy my needy friend and I a pizza for our dinner. Sadly each of us fall into the hopelessly unemployed graduate archetype, and this is our first Christmas away from home. We're currently huddled around my laptop for warmth as we're too afraid of turning the heating on. We would be more than happy to pay it forward when we find jobs. We are located in Berkeley. Thanks for taking the time to read this and we hope you're having a happy Christmas day!
