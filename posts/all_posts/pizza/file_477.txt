Central Missouri, USA.  
The current temp is 105. On the upside I got a potential job offer today! It only took about three months, too! :p !!

I would love some pizza tonight to restore some semblance of normalcy to my life... and after a lot of walking today, the idea of turning on the stove top to make rice again seems depressing.

A haiku to commemorate the day:

Eggs on car hoods fry  
Pavement seems a bit sticky  
Worth it, job offer.
