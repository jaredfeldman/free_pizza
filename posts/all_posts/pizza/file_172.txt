So, I just recently graduated from a business college and earned a diploma to work in an office for admin. I was lucky and got a job right out of school. I had to commute to work and a week in my car died, so I went to a dealership to finance one since I didn't have any money saved. Yesterday I just got let go of my job. I posted about it in r/jobs here: http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1kyxcc/i_got_fired_today_out_of_the_blue/ to gain some sort of advice/motivation. Well my new car has been having troubles and I finally had the time to take it in. Well my piece of shit extended warranty doesn't cover any of the things wrong with it and it's going to cost me 2500 like i have that lying around. So if there's any kinda strangers who can help a sista out with a pizza that would be great. I want pizza is kinda code when I'm just super sad. Since I have Celiac Disease and eating pizza is a treat for me now even though there's more options for us people who can't have gluten. Anywho, if there's any kind soul who can afford a pizza that'd be cool. but even a joke or uplifting advice would be cool too. Thanks. And I hope one day I can return the favour. I live in SK Canada by the way.
