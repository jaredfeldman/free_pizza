Hello!
I've been unemployed since February and so far we've been living on her study loans. Unfortunately she can't get that during the summer - and we got denied social welfare so our debts are piling up right now.

It would be so nice to be able to give my girlfriend a little treat!

We live in Sweden - but I've got a Paypal account.

I would also be happy to take ideas of how we could earn some money! We're kind of out of ideas :)
(We've tried to "get a job" and we've "sold some stuff")

**EDIT: I got pizza money from a very nice redditor! Will post updates within a few days, when I get the money on my bank account!**
