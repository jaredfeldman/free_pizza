Howdy RAOP! I've been in a giant funk lately that I've been unable to pull myself out of, then then tonight my son surprised me. He wrote me a little note saying that I should play Xbox with him and take my "mind off of things," along with other sweet things. 

We played for about 2 hours while he asked me questions about when I was in 3rd grade and joked around about Space Chimps. It was the funnest time I've had in a long time and really reminded me about what's important. 

I don't have access to my account until Monday night since the fiance has my card on a trip for a class for work. I have stuff for the weekend but it's all meals that my son doesn't really enjoy that much. Since neither of us will go hungry this weekend I will completely understand if you would rather give to someone who needs it more than myself, but I would love to treat my "punkin" for everything he did for me tomorrow sometime. Taking a pizza to the park is one of his favorite things.

I will be making offers next week, whether or not I get a pizza so even if you're just reading this and you're hungry be sure to check back with me then. :) 

I think it's time for a great nights sleep now but I will check back tomorrow!
