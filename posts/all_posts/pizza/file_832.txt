My boyfriend and I were living in Chicago while I was attending school, I have just graduated and will be moving to a more affordable residence on Thursday but until then all of our money is currently tied up in application fees, deposits and rent. Anything would make this rather bleak night infinitely better and will be payed forward as soon as we are able.
