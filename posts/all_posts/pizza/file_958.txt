While I do love ramen, its all I have eaten for almost 2 weeks and it will be another 2 weeks till I actually have money that doesn't go directly into gas to get to school (100 a week on gas just to get to school) I don't feel like I can stomach another bowl right now, regardless of how much hot sauce I use. Please help me! I have a Dominos and Papa Johns in walking distance of my house. In return thanks and pictures. When I can I will pay it forward.
