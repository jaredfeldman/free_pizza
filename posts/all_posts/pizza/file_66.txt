Hi first time posting here , I'm extremely hungry right now haven't eaten much today except junk food because there isn't much food at home I like.

I have a decent amount of allergies one of them being soy sauce but my mom still made Stir Fry which has it in it , No she is not a horrible person I just don't like getting heartburn anymore so I generally don't eat it. Fun Fact : I am actually allergic to chicken but can eat it 'Most of the time'. 

I am also transgender not really looking for sympathy but the bar on the right says to list my current situation I also love Parkour that's about all there is to Know I am asking for just a Pepperoni pizza from Papa John's.

If I messed up at all in here please correct me I read the right side bar a couple times but I feel like I am fucking up.

Also my family is not poor feel free to give to someone else in actually NEED for the food I am just hungry and bored.
