Hi, Reddit.  I'm here because I have a favor to ask.  Tonight is my girlfriend and I's one-year anniversary.  It should be a great night, and sadly I just can't make it happen the way I want it to.  I'm broke and can't afford so much as a few wildflowers, let alone dinner.  I'm not looking for something extravagant, but I was hoping I'd be able to find a generous soul willing to help me surprise her.  She knows I can't afford anything, so I know she'll be surprised.  I even made this throwaway account just so she doesn't see a request if she happens to check my reddit activity.  

We're in Minneapolis.  It's a cold night out there and we could really use your help.  Please help me make this an anniversary to remember.  I guarantee that if you can help us out, we'll be talking about the time that reddit helped us celebrate one year together.
