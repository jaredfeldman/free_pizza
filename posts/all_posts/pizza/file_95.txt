Hi there. ill be the first to admit, this is my first time in this subreddit. I only heard about you guys after watching the x-post on /videos but im glad i have.

I am not homeless, nor am i in serious need of a meal but i am a college student who is currently staying for the summer and taking summer classes to make sure i can get out of here as soon as possible because im unfortunately paying my way through school for now. Im lonely up here and all my friends and roommates are home for the summer so its just me up here. I recently split from my girlfriend so that isnt helping my situation. I do have a job but im only getting 10 hours a week (even for summer) so im super low on money right now and havent been able to eat out in weeks. I know most posts arent like this or maybe they are im kinda new to this community, but i would greatly appreciate a pizza, even a personal mini one. Anything at all would boost my spirits and hopefully get me out of this funk. Im here to stay and as soon as i can get enough money to buy myself a pizza ill return the favor and reward someone else in much greater need. Cheers!
