Our family has been going through a rough time lately. We were involved in a car accident on Thanksgiving, and the other driver (who was at fault) was uninsured. My husband was fairly significantly injured, and dealing with the hassles of medical bills, doctor and surgeon appointments, and suing for damages, on top of resuming school/teaching this week (I'm a graduate student) has left me emotionally, physically, and financially drained. 

We have three small kids, and I'm sure pizza would be a huge hit, as we haven't bought food from a restaurant in a LONG time. If anyone would be willing to save me from cooking tonight, I would be eternally grateful.
