Gonna be honest here, I sort of shot myself in the foot. Went to Seattle to meet some buddies from a game I play and kind of spent a bit too much money... We had a blast though! PAX 2011 YEAH! 2 days after PAX 2011... not so yeah. 

Anyway, I get paid on Thursday (well, maybe Thursday, if not this Thursday than next Thursday and if that's true I'm super nyerked) and will DEFINITELY pay the pizza back to some other redditor! Not going to whine if I don't get a pizza but it'd be pretty awesome if my broke, gamer ass got fed D: 

I've been following reddit for awhile now because of my boyfriend, so even though my account is new I've been a lurker on this website for a few months now. He's actually the one who suggested I try reddit because he's at work and can't be much help atm :] 

Anything would be appreciated guys!

(And as much as I love this sub reddit, I feel so guilty using it ;___; )
