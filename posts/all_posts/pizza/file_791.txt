Hello, I've just really had a bad week.  To sum things up, I found out my wife cheated on me 9 days ago.  I've since moved, but my fridge is empty and I'm basically broke due to the move until the 17th.  If you want more details please just look at my post history, but I'd rather keep all of that out of this thread.
 
 
 
I really just want some warm pizza to eat while I watch a few movies with my dogs.  I know I'm posting this on a throwaway account, but I wanted to explain the situation and can't use my main account to protect my self and my (cheating) wife.
 
 
Thanks.
