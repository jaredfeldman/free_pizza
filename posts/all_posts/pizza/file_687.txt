I'm happy to sing for my supper, here's my story so far in handy bullet points:

* moved to another city to stay with a friend who assured me I could stay until I found a job

* friend changed their mind after two weeks and kicked me out

* managed to find a room in the house of a friend of my parents 

* paying $150 a week, no income, is supposed to include food but no food in the house

* to top it all off I'm still unemployed!

So yeah, after paying for food there is nothing to eat. There's no Internet here (my smartphone is my saviour) and my email inbox is full of rejections from jobs I've applied to. Even the local supermarkets aren't hiring!

I would definitely appreciate some cheering up in the form of a pizza if any redditor felt like helping me out :)
