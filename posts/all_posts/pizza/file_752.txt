My wife and I are filing for bankruptcy very soon.  In the meantime, we are very close to running out of food, and we are out of money until I get paid next Friday.  We're not pigs - we can easily make a pizza last for two dinners between the two of us.  It would get us that much closer to my next paycheck without starving.

We would really, really appreciate a pizza from some kind Redditor right about now.  I can provide verification if needed.

Thanks for reading!
