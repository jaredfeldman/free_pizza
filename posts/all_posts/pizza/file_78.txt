Last year, I had to kick my ex out (he was threatening me), and in order to support myself, I took on a second job.  During that time, I bought a pizza for someone who was struggling.  They never came back to thank me :(  But I still felt good :)

Early this year, I had to quit the second job - my doctor said the additional stress was causing hypertension, among other things.  Now, I'm struggling to pay all my bills.  I currently have less than a dollar in my checking account, and missed work yesterday due to illness.  It'd be great to receive a pizza - to be able to skip having to cook tonight since I'm still under the weather.

Any help would be appreciated.  Promise!  :D  Thanks
