Hey everybody,

I've read through a lot of these requests, and there are a lot of people much worse off than I, so if it comes down to it, I hope they get help first.

That being said, I would be extremely grateful if someone would be willing to help me out.  Like I said, I don't have a sob story, no little children's mouth's to feed, but I'm kind of stuck in a rut in life, and I think pizza might cheer me up.

It's Wing Wednesday at Pizza Hut, and I couldn't tell you the last time I didn't have a meal that wasn't prepared out of a plastic bowl or metal cup.  If someone had it in their heart, and wanted to help me out, I would be forever grateful.

Thanks
