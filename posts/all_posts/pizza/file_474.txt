He moved from Indiana to Flagstaff, AZ about two weeks ago, however while driving down to Flagstaff, his car broke down about 100 miles outside of town. So he had to spend all of his money on towing and repairs. He told me yesterday he has never been more hungry in his life and that things aren't going very well for him. Unfortunately, I don't have money to send him an e-card, but I figure some good hearted person on randomactsofpizza (didn't have any luck on the other randomactsofpizza) can help him out. Message me and I will provide his e-mail address for you! Also please pay no mind to my ironically named account, I made it two years ago! I will be very grateful for your kindness and he most certainly will as well!
