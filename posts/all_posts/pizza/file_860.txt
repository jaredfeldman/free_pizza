Short version of my sob story:  We receive food stamps (husband laid off, both of us also working on our bachelors degrees) which honestly keeps us through the month pretty well.  Food stamp card broke in half and can't find a store to honor it.  We ordered a new card but it won't be here for 7-10 business days. Out of pretty much everything but can visit a food pantry day Monday to make ends meet. Right now things are bleak. 

I have a hidden bag a marshmallows in  the back of the cupboard and some wood in the back yard - would love a pizza lunch/dinner and then surprise them with some flaming 'mellows.
