So it's finals week and I haven't eaten all day... I just payed off the last of my housing and I've let my mom borrow around $400, so I don't have much money to get food this week. I would love a pizza, and would love to offer one as soon as I get my money paid back.

Thanks for this subreddit. I think you are all amazing people. :)

Edit:Forgot to say I live in Texas USA. :)
