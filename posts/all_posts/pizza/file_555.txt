Money is incredibly tight right now as I just sent my son to Walt Disney World with his high school marching band for spring break (right around $1400).  Judging from the last surgery I had on my gastrointestinal system, it will be at least 10-12 months before I will be able to enjoy pizza without a fair amount of discomfort.  I might even come out of this totally lactose intolerant, which, holy Horatio Cain, would be a terrible, terrible blow.  

I'd like to spend my last evening with solid food for the forseeable future the way anytrue blue redditor would: on the couch, consuming pizza while watching Archer and Lost on Netflix.
