Hey there fine folks of RAOP! I'm a sophomore here at Texas State University. This year has been particularly tough on me financially, but I've managed to stay afloat until now. I have a disease called Hidradenitis Suppurativa. I would not suggest google searching, unless you'd like to lose your appetite. I've been living with the disease for six years and it's been incredibly difficult. I get large cysts, sometimes the size of baseballs.. in my underarms, between my breasts and in my groin area. This makes it so hard to move any of my extremities, really. My insurance recently stopped paying for my medications, so I'm having to spend $2,200 a month to keep myself able to function properly. I have tried so hard to keep myself above water, but it's impossible with all of the medical bills from radiation therapy (not covered by insurance) and medication expense. I'd really love to have something, ANYTHING for dinner. Of course, when I'm able, I will pay it forward.

EDIT: I can offer to purchase you something from Amazon in exchange for pizza.. I'm broke cash wise, but I do have a bit of money on my Amazon account.
