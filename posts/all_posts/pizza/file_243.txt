So I've been unemployed for awhile now but doing what I need to to make things work and not trying to make it anyone else's problem, got some things going to try to help get me some kind of income going in the meantime. Went to meet someone to sell an item and ended up turning back because they messaged that their car broke down. No big deal, stuff happens. Went to HEB to get some milk and bread, basic staple stuff. Card declined. Try again. Declined again. Insert sinking feeling here. Try once more as credit. No dice. So I left empty handed. Get home and check the bank account to see what has happened, because I had at least $20 to my name. Nope. I'm now negative almost $200 due to a payment I wasn't aware was hitting today. Fantastic.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Now, I have food, it's just not anything special (ramen, pasta, rice). That said, I would much rather people more needy than I get pizza'd. But if someone felt like helping a guy not feel like he's at the bottom of a dry well, I'd be quite thankful.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="TL;DR"&gt;

Tried to buy basic foodstuffs, bank account surprise-buttsex, feels bad man.
