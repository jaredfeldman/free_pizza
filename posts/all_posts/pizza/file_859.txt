I am an out of work phlebotomist struggling to get by at the moment while I find another hospital to work at.  The bills are piling up and I have no money to pay them.  What bothers me the most about my situation is that my boyfriend, who is super patient and cooperative with me while i'm losing my mind trying to find a job, helps me however I need to whether it is financial or a simple hug at the end of his long day to cheer me up a bit.  I am very upset that I lost my independence...

My boyfriend has been on a diet (Keto) for a few months, and he has decided that he is going to have a "cheat day" on his birthday which is in a few days. He has been my rock through these long months and I have nothing to give to him and no money to buy him a gift or even cook him something for his cheat day.  He has done so much for me and all I want to do is give something back to him.  If there is anyone out there that can help me out on his birthday, I'd be so happy!  Even if I can't get a proper gift for him, I think pizza on one of his cheat days should suffice :)

Once I get back on my feet, I am going to send a pizza to some lovely redditors to return the kindness.
