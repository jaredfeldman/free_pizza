Hello,

I asked an old roommate if he could help me out, and he pointed me to this site. I'm not sure how this works or really what I'm doing. Basically, I was really stupid, and somehow left my refrigerator door open, and my electricity bill went from around $40 to an unexpected $100. I'm honestly not sure what I'm going to do about food in the upcoming week, since I'm out the grocery money I was expecting. I have about 15$ in my wallet, but until they 15th I won't have a paycheck to do anything else. Please let me know if I have to do anything to prove this. I'm embarrassed that I have to beg. To be honest, my stomach hurts today from eating only bread that I froze to make it last longer.

Best regards,

Allen
