My mother is away on holiday for 5 days. Don't want to sound like she abandoned me or anything, I was happy to stay and watch our dogs. The only thing is, she didn't leave me money, instead she actually bought food at supermarket for me. She didn't realize though that the food she had left me wouldn't last the entire weekend because its now out of date. Not her fault if anything probably mine since I already ate the food that wouldn't be out of date on Thursday and Friday and left the now out of date food (stupid I know) and now I got no food or money until Tuesday. All I would be looking for is a plain margarita pizza.

It would be absolutely amazing if someone was to buy me a pizza for my dinner later tonight!
