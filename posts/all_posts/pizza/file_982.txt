At this point austerity measures have been enacted weeks ago. I've been learning to cook cheap plentiful stables, like rice, rice, and also rice. Loan disbursement was supposed to kick off yesterday but after consulting with my massively inept financial aid office it seems that my loan has been lost in the aether. I'm a little dizzy and a lot pissed off and a hot delicious pizza would do wonders for my mood.  Would anyone kindly help me out?
