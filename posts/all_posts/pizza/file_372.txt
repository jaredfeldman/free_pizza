I spent a few years in the military, now I'm back in school and using grants to pay for everything.  My application for the IVG (Illinois Veteran's Grant) wasn't processed properly and I need to send it back in with my dd-214 (military service record).  In lieu of the grant paying my tuition for this semester I had to take a heavy chunk of money out of my checking to pay for this semester until that finally gets processed/approved to update my account at the university.  I have about 4$ till the 1st and I'm trying to stretch every bit of rice and lentils I have left in the pantry.  I would greatly appreciate a pizza this evening, thank you for your consideration!
