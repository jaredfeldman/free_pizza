Nobodys fault but mine, i didnt get my card out of the atm quick enough. ( i dropped my bag and all my stuff fell out ) It was eaten ( by the machine ) and blocked..   we only just got paid and we have no food. I need to wait a few days for the new card to arrive. This is soooo stupid but i feel really bad. Im not the only one who will be hungry becuase of this. Please please.  


I know this is a new acc but i am a active redditor of a few years , can pm you if you like. A friend is also a reddior ,has started checking on me and dont want to worry them as i know she cant help.
