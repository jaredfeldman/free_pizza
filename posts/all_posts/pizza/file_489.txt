My dad has been battling problems both with money and with alcoholism, and when I tried to mention it to him, he misconstrued it and went somewhat berserk. I left home the next day (yesterday) and returned to Chicago several days before the dorms reopen. One of my friends was gracious enough to let me stay in her apartment, but I feel really guilty about both using her utilities and stealing her food.

I was just wondering if anyone would be kind enough to lend me a pizza that I can spread out over the next couple days. I went job hunting today and plan to spend the rest of the evening filling out applications, so I promise that I will return the favor as soon as I have enough money. Thank you!
