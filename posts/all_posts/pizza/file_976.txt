i couldnt afford to take the gf out for our 9 yr anniversary.. been applying to jobs round the clock but nobody is hiring out here. i'd really appreciate it if somebody could throw me a giftcard or something, otherwise it's ramen again for dinner. (and we're running low on that, too)

either way, thanks to y'all for being so awesome and helping out others. this subreddit warms my heart.
