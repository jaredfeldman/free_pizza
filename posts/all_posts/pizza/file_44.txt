I'm at an internship right now and not only do I get paid diddly squat, but I don't get paid till next week. I have no money and no food until next week. I would much appreciate a little kindness and as soon as I get paid, it's pizza for everyone! well maybe not everyone...

I hate asking for favors, but I need a little help here...
