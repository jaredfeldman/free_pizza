I'm not going to bore you with a long-winded explanation. It's simple. I'm broke, hungry, a week from payday and have now been informed I'm working a graveyard shift.

I'm also a self-published author who is in the midst of finishing up his second fantasy novel, which will be published in print and ebook, and I'm willing to give someone a free copy of the book, AND include you as a character in the fifteenth chapter of the sequel. You will be forever immortalized as a character in fantasy fiction.
