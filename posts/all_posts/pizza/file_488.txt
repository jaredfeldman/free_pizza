Held a contest for a pizza/gift card 
http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/13mkvq/offer_make_me_laugh_get_pizza/

BestDLine won and he wanted a Dominoes so I have gone to buy him a gift card but the website (after putting in my details) rejects my card and says "We currently only support U.S. customers."

Anyway round this? Or advice on what to do 
Thanks
