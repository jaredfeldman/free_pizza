Hi this week i got a speeding ticket running late to work and almost lost my job since the companies insurance almost dropped me (I work for a car dealership as a porter). So i had to dig into my food money to pay it off and ive been bumming food for lunch all week and am all out of rice and bread (dinner of champions) so i was wondering if anyone would be willing to help me out since it's been a rough week.
