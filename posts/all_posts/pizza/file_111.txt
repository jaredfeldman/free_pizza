I had applied for this job that would have been perfect for me.  My current job is so stressful it puts me in tears every other week, and with Christmas coming it is just bound to get worse.  I went in and interviewed and they said they would talk it over.  They hadn't expected to hire anyone but my application had skills on it that are just rare and they could use.  (i worked in an engraving/framing shop, and they have an engraving part to their store)

Turns out though that my available hours just aren't what they're looking for.  I can either compromise my study time for school to take this job, causing me school stress, or i can stay at my already shitty place but not have school stress.  Either way, stress.

So i'm bummed, and could really use a pizza.  Or better yet, subway, since i'm supposed to be on a diet/making a life change.  But today i just don't care as much about that as i should.  Between finding that out, and my desktop computer with all my awesomeness not turning on yesterday, my thanksgiving break has just been shit.   

(No idea what's wrong with the computer.  it's getting power, but when it turns on it sounds like eight hundred fans turn on inside, and it never goes to a login screen.  I don't know enough about computers to fix it. That was usually the ex-husbands job)

long story short, my computer is broke, and i didn't get a job that would have made my life hella easier.  I'm bummed and want to eat comfort food.

fyi- would have to be for pickup.  I live too far out for delivery.
