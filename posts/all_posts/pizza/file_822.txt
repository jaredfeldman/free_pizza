Hello, I've never posted on here before so please excuse me if I'm doing this wrong. 

I found out today the company I work for hasn't been making any money for awhile now and will have to close soon, meaning I will soon be out of a job. I'm so tired after sending out resumes all night long that I don't even want to think about making dinner. A pizza would be much appreciated. 

Hope you all are having a better day then mine! Thanks
