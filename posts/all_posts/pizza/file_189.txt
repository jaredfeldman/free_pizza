The three of us are here at work at the campus computer repair desk. It's the end of the semester and we're all kind of hurting on cash, and it would be awesome to get a little pizza to share and make sure we aren't wasting an hour of $8/hour pay.

R_A_O_P is awesome, and we'd really appreciate it. I really hate asking for stuff like this, but pizza sounds delicious right now.

Thanks for considering us.
