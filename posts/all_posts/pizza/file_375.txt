Title says it all... I had some unexpected expenses today that drained me of my money for the rest of the week. Haven't eaten since I had a cup of yogurt about 13 hours go and I'm startin' to feel it. If anyone is able to help me out with a small pepperoni I'd truly appreciate it, and if you're into gaming I can shoot you an invite to DotA 2!
