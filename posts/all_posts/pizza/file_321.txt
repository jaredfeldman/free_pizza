Hello RAOP

I have an old friend in town this weekend. He is stopping by later today to watch some football and hang out for a while. I have no real food in my house to offer while he is over here, and I don't get paid until the end of the week. I hate to be a bad host, could anyone help me out with a delicious pizza to feed us growing men? I will be paying it forward regardless at the end of the week.

I live in Wilmington, DE (Right outside Philadelphia). I have all the majors around, Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns.

Thanks for considering helping me out!!
