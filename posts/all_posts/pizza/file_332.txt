Hey guys, this week was the week my rent was due and because of that, I have about 20 dollars to last me for food/public transit to work every day this week until I get paid on Friday. A simple pizza would be appreciated, and in the future, I can try and get you a better pizza in return. Thank you, and I appreciate the help, if I get it.
