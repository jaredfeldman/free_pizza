So I'm sitting here reading through one of my many favorite subreddits, the wife has the tv on and all they keep showing is pizza commercials. Now that has me hungry for pizza. Anybody have an extra pizza out there that they aren't using? I could put it to good use! My pizza factor would go up by a thousand fold!
