Not sure if this is the purpose of this reddit. Please excuse the new account, I saw this on the news, what an amazing idea!

I am currently living with a roommate who has just moved out of her mother's house, she has no job and her mother sends her utility and rent money. Her only responsibility is to send her mom the rent bill, and she sends half of that or pays half to the company. The problem is that this girl is SO lazy, can't be bothered to send the bills, can't be bothered to call her mom for rent and I'm under the impression she told her mom she already had a job (her mom has been chiding her for not having a job), so her mother does not feel obligated to pay this girl's bills. I have been carrying the weight of the major bills, such as electricity and rent (2x), and my paycheck is being stretched thin. To top it off, it's obvious to see where she gets her flaky attitude from...her mother REFUSES to answer my phone calls or emails. So here I am reddit, living with a girl who labels her food in the fridge so I don't touch it, and for the sake of keeping the peace...I am down to begging for a pizza X(.  I would prefer giftcards, because I would rather give out my email address than my physical address, but I will understand those who dont want to in case they believe I am a scammer.
