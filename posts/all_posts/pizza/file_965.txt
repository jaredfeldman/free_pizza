[relevant source as to why I would ask total strangers for pizza](http://i.imgur.com/nhCti.png)

I'm a little down on my luck for a few days and if anyone can spare the charity of a sausage/pepperoni pizza, it'd be well appreciated. Thank you for your time and happy holidays. 

I live in North Georgia, near Berry College. I made a throwaway at first, but the peeps in the RAOP chatroom told me it'd be more genuine if I posted on my main. It's a little embarrassing to ask, but all I ask for is charity in exchange for my humility.
