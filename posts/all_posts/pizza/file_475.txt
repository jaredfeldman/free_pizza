I have asked once and I deleted it due to comments that where made. A nice person wrote me and told me this is called trolling and to post again. I need help feeding a family of six tonight. Could anyone possibly help me with a couple of large pizzas and maybe something cold to drink. As god as my witness when i am able to I will return the favor. Either way God Bless and please pray for our family prays move mountains
