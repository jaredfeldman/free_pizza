First time posting here, though I've checked it out a few times. The GF and I are getting a bit hungry and I'm trying to figure out what to do until payday. I've got $8 in the bank and my fridge is empty. Got 2  packages of Ramen and I get paid in 5 days. Anyone want to buy an acoustic guitar?

  A pizza with lots of meat on it sounds good right about now, and once I can finally get all my bills situated then odds are I'll be back to return the favor!  
  
  Oh yeah. Pictures of fridge upon request?
