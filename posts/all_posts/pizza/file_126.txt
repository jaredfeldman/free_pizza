I'm a college student, so I don't have much money, and I'm home (in Texas, if that's important) over Christmas break. But I've been sick this whole week. My whole family is gone to work or school and I don't have much energy for making food. A small pizza, even just bread sticks, would be nice. Thanks for reading this :)
