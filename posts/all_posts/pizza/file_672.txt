Hello all. Having been laid off in March, the last few months have been lean for my partner and I, but I finally got a job today! I don't start until September so there are still plenty more nights of pasta and pulses, I just wondered if someone might be able to put a cheese-topping on what has been a long awaited good day and let us go to bed tonight fat and happy on Pizza? I'll pay it forward with my first paycheque and be eternally grateful. Many thanks to all of those wonderful people who make this subreddit a garden of kindness and hope.
