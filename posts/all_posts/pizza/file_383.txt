I am currently 18 and living on my own, and I have not eaten in the last three days, I am $-1 in the bank, I can provide with proof if required. My check should come on Tuesday, and until that arrives I will be with out any food. I tried contacting my former stepmother for help but that hasn't been any help at all, just voice mail. Any help will be greatly appreciated, and I will attempt to pay it forward the second I can. 

 Thank you for taking your time to read this. I greatly appreciate it. 

Edit: I can provide whatever proof you may need
