I am packing up the belongings of the house I grew up in, before I turn the keys over to the bank. I am prepping my cat for a week and a half of boarding, so that he has somewhere to stay, while I couchsurf and scramble to find a job. I spent the last of my unemployment today hiring a U-Haul and I'm down to leftovers. I could really use some comfort food right about now, with the added bonus of having something for breakfast in the morning.

Edit: I will more than happily repay this kindness if/when I get back on my feet.
