I could really use some help. I took my dog [Volk](http://tinypic.com/r/241rqmf/7), he was 25% Timber Wolf 75% German Sheperd, to the vet yesterday because he stopped eating and was generally acting really weird, not wanting to move. It had been getting worse over the course of last week. After the vet's initial examination, he thought it had something to do with Volks kidneys, so I left him with the vet overnight. I got a call this morning from the Vet's office, telling me that it was some congenital disease, that causes terminal kidney failure and that though I could probably keep him alive on dialysis for a while, it would be extremely expensive and he wouldn't be living a full, happy life. So, I went in this morning and said good-bye. 
Anyway, the total cost of the visit, tests, and euthanasia was close to $300, all of which I had to pay up front. That was supposed to be grocery money. I feel bad asking for help from people I don't even know, but all my roommates and friends went home for the summer, and I promise I'll pay it forward.

I'm in Dallas.
