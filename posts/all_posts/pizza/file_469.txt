Before I begin with why I'd like a pizza, I just want to say that all of you are wonderful human beings for the generosity you show. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. This isn't a sob story, I hope it doesn't come off that way. I understand life gets people down sometimes and mine has been especially hard to me lately. I'm just trying to explain my situation.

I recently got released from the hospital due to a bad bout of pneumonia. My insurance company wanted a deposit of 300 dollars. I'm a student and have my own apartment and support myself completely on my own, so this was a HUGE hit to me. I also just paid rent, my phone bill, internet bill, and some of my tuition for this coming semester, and BARELY scraped by, even though I had been saving all of my money other than that and some groceries.

I'm currently unemployed as well. I had a bicycle but I had to sell it in order to pay my deposit. My disability check does not come until the 3rd of July and I currently have 20 dollars in cash on me to last until then.
I'm going to go buy some ramen noodles and soup mix once it cools down outside. My lungs are bad and it's stressful for me to walk in this kind of heat.

If anyone would like to donate a pizza to me, it would feed me for 3 or 4 days (I'm not a big eater). I only ever eat pizza when my friends have it, so it would not only feed me, but be a real treat for me as well! 
I just have to tell you I am allergic to any kind of mushrooms. Anything other than that, I'm not picky at all.

Thank you so much for reading this, and I hope that soon I am in the position to donate a pizza to somebody else.
