Hello, RAoP. I am currently sitting at my desk at work looking over my checkbook register, sighing at the fact that I have $1.85 left to last me until May 3rd. Yesterday I spent my last little bit of money on a birthday present for my daughter, who turns 4 tomorrow. It has also been raining the last week and a half. Could really go for a tasty pizza when I get off of work just to cheer me up, and will pay it forward hopefully on the 3rd when I get paid again. 
 Thanks for reading.
