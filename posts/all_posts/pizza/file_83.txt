EDIT: TAKEN CARE OF YAY.

Hello lovely Pizza Givers,

I'm a young gal living in Brooklyn, and I just moved from my cozy apartment into a basement room. I'm very sad to have left what was my home, my cat won't come out from under the couch, and moving down four flights of narrow stairs really made my tummy rumble. After paying for a U-haul and a huge load of cleaning supplies, I'm out of disposable income until my next paycheck, but goodness would I love a delicious, cheesy, pipin' hot pizza. 

Thanks to all the kind souls who are putting faith in humanity back into the aether.

LOVE,
T.

P.S. I know this is a blankish account. I'm a lurking sort of lady. If you'd like any further verification from me, I can do that. Also, I'll draw anyone a sketch who asks for one, just for shits and giggles.

P.P.S. OHMYGLOB. The amazing pizzamom gifted me a pizza and I am so very pleased. Expect photos shortly.
