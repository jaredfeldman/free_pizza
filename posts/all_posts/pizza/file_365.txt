I'm helping my friend out who got kicked out of his house, letting him crash here and offering my time and whatever else he needs. As a result of helping him drink his way out of this (not healthy, I know, but we all deal in different ways, and he IS looking for a new place) we're broke and I'm out of ideas to cheer him up. Then I saw this place. It would be a perfect story, and cheer him up immensely, if some random stranger on the internet helped us out.
