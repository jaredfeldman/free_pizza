I don't normally ask for things from people, especially ones I don't know, but this subreddit seems pretty awesome..

My backstory:
I'm a 24 year old single dad with full custody of my 5 year old. Things have been really tight for years..pretty much since I graduated high school. I pay for everything on my own and between rent, car payment, utilities, groceries, and a $440 daycare bill every month there isn't much left. His mother chips in $75/month which doesn't even pay for a week of daycare. 

Anyway, my son starts elementary school next week and is scared to death. Would love to surprise him with a pizza :]

Since I won't be having that massive daycare bill next month I will gladly pay it forward!
