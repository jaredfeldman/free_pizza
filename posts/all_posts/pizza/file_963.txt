Y_Y. Sorry, **do not** want to sound like a pity party, but I was on my way to Vermont from California to go back to school when Irene hurricane shit all over my face. Now I'm stranded in Chicago and I don't know what to do with myself since this has never happened to me before whilst traveling alone. I'm only a naive, pitiful 19 year old after all :(. And, the room charge was ridiculous so I can't really spare the moola for any delicious pie right now. 

Well anyway, even if I don't receive any pizza tonight, daz cool! I know I'm not the only idiot attempting fly during a hurricane. Just some comments would greatly brighten my night!
