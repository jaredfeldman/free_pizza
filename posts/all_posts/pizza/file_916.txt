I got fired from my job (car broke down and I worked about 25 miles away from home) about 2 months ago and have been managing but the money has just finally run out.  I literally had cheese and pickles here to eat last night.  I'm starting a temp job on Sunday (finally :D) so hopefully I will be able to give in the near future.  

This is a great subreddit btw.  It really restores my faith in humanity.
