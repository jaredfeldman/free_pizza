Hey guys, Philly redditor here. I lost my job last week and I've been getting by with cups of noodles and tuna and rice for the past few days, I'd really appreciate a real meal. My roommate's gone this weekend so this would be able to feed me for the next couple days. 

I'm sure people frequently say "Oooh get me pizza and I'll get you back sometime pinky promise" and then never cash in on that promise. Well I won't lie. I'm pretty broke, and until August when new job starts, I can't promise I'll get you guys back. So no empty promises for now. But I can tell you guys I'm hungry and broke, and it would be amazing if any of you could help me. 

Thank You
