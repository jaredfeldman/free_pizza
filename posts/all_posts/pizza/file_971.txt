My daughter just recently started kindergarten, and after lots of worrying she seems to be doing really well. (She's a trooper!) I promised her a special dinner this week and she'd specifically requested pizza, but I had some unexpected bills and now pizza isn't really an option.

It would really make her week and mine if someone would throw us a pie (and possibly some breadsticks--she loves dipping!)

Thanks for reading!
