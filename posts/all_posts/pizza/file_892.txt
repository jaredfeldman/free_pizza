Hey I just moved here to Sacramento starting a new job. I was supposed to get my paycheck last week but the damn thing must have gotten lost in the mail because there is no sign of it yet (not at old address either). Reaaaally hopin it would show up today since I've been without food since yesterday. Anyway, I fully plan on reciprocating once I get paid so It's more like a pizza loan. I don't know really too many people yet here in this town so I'm coming to you guys. Cheers!
