Reddit I've been eating linguine (which I don't know when and why I bought) for dinner and lunch for the past 3 days since it's the only thing left in my apartment.

I would be delighted if I could taste a pizza or something better tonight, can you please help me? :D

I can PM you the verification code.

Thanks guys!
