Hey, our flats electricity bill came through the other day, so we're all pretty skint and hungry right now. Can't think of anything we could give anyone really. We CAN, however, offer love and the promise of a future pizza to a further lost soul on the road to happiness.

And we're in the uk!

Thanks!
