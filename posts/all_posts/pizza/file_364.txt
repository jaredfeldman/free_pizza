Current situation: So, for the last two weeks, things haven't been so great. Not only have I've been fighting a bad cold for over 3 weeks, my wallet has been stolen, my pet has died, and I was denied a job interview because I'm going to school.
For the past 2 to 3 days, I have been eating sparingly out of 4"x7" box of leftovers from a friend's dinner party. 
I hate asking for things, but, I am really hungry. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could help me out. Thank you.
