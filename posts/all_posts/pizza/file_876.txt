I'm not in College, or a starving artist or anything like that. I've just been a bit unlucky lately. I'm a 36 year old single guy with a job. But rent, and other bills killed me this month. I thought I had enough funds in my account to at least keep me set with Mr. Noodles, I forgot about my monthly banking fee.

I had a small bag of chips Wednesday afternoon, and I get paid Monday, so I'll be fine then.. It's just really painful at this point and food is something I'm constantly thinking about.

I've got a few bucks to get on the bus to work on Saturday, so I can't really use that.

I'm really embarrassed to even be asking like this and I'm not sure how it works, so please be patient with me.

I guess that covers it. Thank you in advance.

Cheers folks.
