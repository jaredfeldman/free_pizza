The title pretty much explains it. I live in New York and flying home to CA for the week isn't worth the expensive plane ticket, and my personal income is quite dismal as a college student, so any Spring Break destination is out of the question. I understand that a lot of people are in the same situation and that it probably isn't the best time to ask for help, but I thought might as well try. It would really be appreciated!
