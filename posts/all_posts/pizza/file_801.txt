I am serving my second AmeriCorps term in Denver, CO.  My food stamp case was recently closed because they send the follow-up paperwork to my previous address despite me calling and updating my address when I moved.  It will take approximately a month to go through the process again and receive food stamps.  If you're familiar with AmeriCorps, you know we serve nonprofit organizations for a very, very small monthly stipend.  Any assistance would be appreciated from the bottom of my heart!

TL;DR: Food stamps taken away through no fault of my own and I could use the help!
