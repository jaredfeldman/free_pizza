I am an unemployed musician in Tennessee who can't offer much except a place to stay and some possible unpaid shows to bands passing through. I am currently hosting a 4 piece band from upstate NY for a couple of days. Normally we can busk downtown for some extra food money but we've only made $13 bucks between the 5 of us in the past couple of days. Any help with a couple of pizzas and I'll send you a free download link!

EDIT: SallyMacLennane just made everyones night! Not only will I personally be paying this back, but the boys in the band have all subscribed and plan on doing their thing to help out in the future!
