~~I've been broke since the middle of the month, with not even $5 in my account at the moment. I've got a little bit of food, but it's only enough ramen to feed one person here, and there is two (A relative). I've been wanting pizza for two months, but haven't really had the cash. As with most of the recent posts here, I'll get paid on Friday, and would gladly reimburse you after then. It's 8pm here, as of this post. My only local pizza place is Dominos.~~

~~And hey, if you've got Steam, I can give you some trading cards I have left over, if that's your thing.~~

EDIT: I've been pizza'd!
