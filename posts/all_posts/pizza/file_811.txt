Hey all.  My wife is away on business tonight, so it's just me an my daughter.  Well, had an unexpected bill come out of my checking account today putting me in the negative.  My little one has been begging me for pizza all morning.  We won't starve without it, but it'd be awesome if I could grab her a pie tonight.  I'll repay the kindness for sure.
