Thanks for getting this far. Not to pile on the bad news, because it really isn't that bad, but I just got a call from the landlord that the power's been out for a few hours in my complex, and to be careful of the food in the fridge when I get back from work. Sounds like it could be a long day. I understand that my posting history isn't too broad, but is  I'm a long time lurker and this account is two months old. Maybe someone can help me out. Thanks and have a good day!

EDIT: I totally meant October 25th, not May 15. That'd be silly.
