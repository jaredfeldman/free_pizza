My job barely pays the bills, my food budget for the week is spent, and she's been putting extra hours in at her new retail job... so she can buy/ship all 5 of her sisters(plus parents, grandparents, ect) Christmas gifts this year since we live in a different state and won't be able to get together like they do every year.

Even if it's just a simple $5 Little Caesar's it would make her day to be able to be able to 'eat out' instead of the same meals I cook(she works  evenings) day in and out :P
