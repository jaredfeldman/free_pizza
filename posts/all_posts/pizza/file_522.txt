I'm not going to do the whole sob story, I'm just gonna say: 21, female, rather strapped for cash at the moment. I'm alone for Christmas because I'm stuck in town working and all my friends are going and visiting their families like most average people. My next decent paycheck isn't until January 10th (I do have a very small one coming in on Friday, but because one of my two jobs isn't active during the winter break, said check will be very small and immediately eaten by groceries). I'm not out of food yet and can probably make it until then. I'm just kind of lonely and really want a pizza.

I'm prepared to do that verification thingy mentioned in the sidebar. I am also prepared to make you a really bad drawing in MS Paint, because I'm bored and don't have that much to do.

Also, Merry slightly-early Christmas!
