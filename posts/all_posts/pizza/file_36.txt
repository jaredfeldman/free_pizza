I've been down on my luck lately. I have a job but I just can't get hours :&lt; (I'm trying to get a different job right now) not to mention that they didn't even pay me for my work last week (I've talked to them about it and I'm waiting for my paycheck but who knows when that will show up).  I did get a check to help pay for food from a non profit group my mom deals with but I was stupid and didn't cash it but deposited it. So I may be able to use it Tuesday or so but I'm running out of food. Overall I would love a pizza to nibble on for the next couple of days. I also do plan on helping people out here once my financial situation is all settled :3
