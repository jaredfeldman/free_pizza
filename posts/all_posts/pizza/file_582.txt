I'm a student who just finished with finals, so I can't complain I need brain food or anything, but honestly the paycheck I received most recently was from Thanksgiving week, and I got paid about $140 less than I usually make. Because of this, almost all of it went to Christmas presents.  I tried to buy a bag of chips the other day and my card was declined. I have overdue bills, an empty stomach, and no way to fix either. I don't get paid until Thursday, which is approaching quickly, but not quickly enough. Please help a hungry Redditor out tonight with a pizza, I would be forever in your debt if you did
