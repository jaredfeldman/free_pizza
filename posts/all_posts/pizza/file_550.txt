Posting here in hopes of pizza. Bit of a story!

Husband works CONSTANTLY to support us. right now I'm 23 weeks pregnant (see r/babybumps) and after moving back into our apartment due to MIL troubles we're broke til next payday. It's my fault that we're broke which is why I'm secretly posting here while husband is at work and cannot see it. Insurance refuses to cover my prenatal now for some reason so our spare food/gas money has gone to those. 

I am out of work sadly (was collecting SSI for my disability but they cut it off as soon as I got pregnant and no one wants to hire a pregnant woman even for a temp :(  )

So just hoping for a meal for when husband comes home from work :(
