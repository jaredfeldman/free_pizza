Hi, RAOP. So, things are bad: I'm waiting on help from my relatives to pay rent (late) and utilities (also late). My girlfriend and I haven't been able to find work and are having a very hard time making ends meet. The power was shut off this morning, and we don't have enough money to get it turned on--or any food that doesn't require cooking.

I'm looking into getting help from relatives sooner rather than later on the power bill, but I don't know exactly when that's going to happen. At this point, I'd judge this request to be more of a need than a want. 

Full disclosure: We've gotten pizza through RAOP twice. Once was through a request a few weeks ago, and the other was a totally unsolicited offer after my girlfriend got into a conversation with someone here. Both times we were a bit better off than we are now, but we didn't have much to eat in the house and we couldn't afford the pizza ourselves. 

Oh, I should mention--I have a battery backup that's giving us Internet access at the moment. It'll be out of juice sometime today, so we'll either use the last of our batteries to use a nearby wireless network or head to the library. 

Thanks for staying with me through this wall of text. 

Edit: Girlfriend said I should offer proof as there's been a lot of fake requests and offers here lately. We can give you a picture of the shutoff notice, or something like that. Reply or send a PM.
