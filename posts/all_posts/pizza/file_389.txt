Been having a very rough time with a few surprise expenses and I have incoming income but it won't be here for about a week. I'm not exactly at "ramen is all I have" status but potatoes, beans, rice, and cream o' wheat will only go so far and a pizza will hold me over for darn near 3 days before I actually finish it. Would anyone care to show me some pizza love?

Fair warning: I may decide to try to talk you out of it if you try to help... don't let me. It's something between pride and optimism... :)
