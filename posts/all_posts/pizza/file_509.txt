So, I didn't find out my wife was leaving me today, I found that out a couple weeks ago, but, I did find out it was for another guy today. Worst day of my life, and I need something to eat, but I don't feel motivated to do anything, not even cook. I would be appreciative of whomever would like to help me out, and I'll pass it on when I get paid on Thursday.
