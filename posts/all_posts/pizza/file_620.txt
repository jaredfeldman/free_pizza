Hey guys, my heater broke down and I won't be able to pay for a new one for at least two months with how work, my classes and such are treating me. It's a harsh world out there, but I'm asking for one extending hand to reach out to me and offer me a hot meal. It'd be great to know that someone cares about your well-being. Thank you if you decided to read



Edit: I'm still very hungry and in need. Please help me out if you can
