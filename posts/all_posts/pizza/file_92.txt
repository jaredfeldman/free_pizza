My partner and I will have been together (in person) 7 years tomorrow (April 16).

We meet online while I was teaching in Korea. When I finished my contract, I went home (NZ) for a month before I flew to Sweden to meet him in real life. Prior to that we'd Skype 6-7 hours a day, email and send letters

Life has been really hard. I haven't been able to go back to NZ, we had to go through his family company (no fault of their own) going through bankruptcy, moving country and visa issues.

We left our jobs at the end of January and moved out of London in the hopes that we could find a place to settle down and have kids. 
We lived in at our jobs and worked together in a very stressful situations that really began to affect our relationship and health. Another reason we needed to move.

We've found it really hard to find jobs since though we've applied for everything and anything, pub jobs, cleaning jobs anything.

Tomorrow is our 7 year anniversary and we can't afford to do anything.
Which is ok, we still have each other and we're getting along really well again despite the pressures and stress of both being out of work and worried sick about money.

Anyhow, a pizza tomorrow night would be well-appreciated.
And the favour will be paid forward as soon as we're in work again.
