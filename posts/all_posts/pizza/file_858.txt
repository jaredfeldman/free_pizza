I recently moved out to AZ from LV and well... my story consists of heartbreak, pawning of items, and basically picking myself up from the ground.

I'll be more than glad to share my story, but honestly I could use a pizza. I've got no money for dinner and i've been making due with some ramen but yeah...It'd be nice to have a pizza.

I'm usually on the other end of this but this time I could really use the help.
