I have a couple babysitting gigs lined up next week, but I won't have a single dollar until next week. I'm trying to figure something out until then, but a pizza would last me the rest of the week. I'm in Missouri. Please, for the love of pizza, show me the good side of reddit! You all have saved me in so many ways, but this is my first time asking for a real life helping hand. Thank You!
