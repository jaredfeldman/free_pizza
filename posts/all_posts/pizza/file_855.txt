Well, this is my first time on RAoP. So I figured I'd try it out. I'm home sick today, don't have my license (thank you bureaucracy), with a beat up leg (http://i.imgur.com/jrQCk.jpg), broke (http://i.imgur.com/DNEEd.jpg ) (The irony is the picture of the contents of my wallet has 'need' in the URL). Anyways, if someone could get me some pizza before 5 today, I would love you forever. Anyways, thanks in advance.
P.S. Just whacked my head getting up to get my iphone to take some proof pics. Anyways :P
