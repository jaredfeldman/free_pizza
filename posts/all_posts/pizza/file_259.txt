I'm not the type of person to ask for anything but this past January I lost my job due to going partially blind in my left eye. I have struggled ever since to find any work and have been going from couch to couch. I've been fortunate enough to be able to house sit for a week. Unfortunately the  people im house sitting for have no food here and I'm down to .05 cents to my name. A pizza would really cheer me up right now.
