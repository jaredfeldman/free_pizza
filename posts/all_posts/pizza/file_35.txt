My mom is bed-ridden because of the prolonged symptoms of her brain surgery(she had a brain tumor). Stepdad has had surgery on both his knees and is the primary bread winner for the family. Brother works for a grocery store but he's putting his money into college. I'm going to college now and need a job asap.

A pizza would be great!

Edit: I live in Ventura, California USA
