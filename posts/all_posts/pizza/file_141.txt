Having a rough couple days up here at sacred heart. No money to eat and the cafeteria charges $2 for a 20 Oz. soft drink. The hospital food is horrible and they only give enough for the patient. A pizza would be absolutely amazing. thank you to all who read/comment. your time is much appreciated. Proof is available.
