Hey, 

So I'm currently on winter break, and  I've been waiting for a check from my parents since I've been unable to go home for the holidays. Unfortunately it didn't come today and now I'm broke, with literally no food. Literally none. I hope it comes in the mail tomorrow if so I promise to get someone a pie. I can take a picture of my fridge if need be. 

If someone is able to do this I can also pay it forward tomorrow :).
