Hi guys, 
Normally I'm not one to ask for charity but I *really* need some help this time. I've been working a crappy, minimum wage job for the past year, and I finally got a new position working in a dental office (which is what my degree is actually in, but I haven't found a position until this past week), but I don't start there until mid-June. :( 
My boyfriend, who I live with, got laid off this past March and applied for unemployment benefits shortly after, but of course, nothing has been solidified on that end yet. I'm sure it's to everyone's surprise that the unemployment office isn't super reliable, right?...

So, I am here asking for some kindness to be brought upon us, as these past few months have been particularly trying for us financially. I am also in the process of recovering from a bad car accident a few weeks ago, so I've also had to worry about finding a new car, as well as trying to find a new, cheap apartment since our lease is up in July. Sigh. Growing up sucks sometimes.

To anyone that even took the time to read this, thank you! And if anyone even considers doing this favor for us, I promise you will be repaid in some form or another! You have no idea how much it would mean to us to not have to worry about dinner tonight. We are genuine people, we have just fallen on some hard times.

**Thank you!**
