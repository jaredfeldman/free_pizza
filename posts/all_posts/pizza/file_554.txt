Just rescued two cats (http://imgur.com/fBpUELb) from our neighborhood and brought them in for vaccinations today. I ended up having to empty my bank account (~$200) for the FVRCP shots, parasite tests, exam fees and IV Fluids for one that was dehydrated. They're home now and finally warming up to me! 

I'd love a pizza (and I'm sure they'll be fighting me for it). 

Thanks!
