We both work but it's still paycheck to paycheck. I sold an item on ebay to get some extra cash but since it was an awkward item to ship(giant plush lady and the tramp dog), it jacked the shipping from $30 to $58, I had to pay the $28 out of pocket since I told the buyer it would be only $30. So that sapped our funds until we get paid tomorrow. Until then, we starve as we have nothing at the house to eat. Not trying to give a sob story, just being honest.

But hey if we got a pizza, maybe the wife would stop bragging about pinterest :-)
