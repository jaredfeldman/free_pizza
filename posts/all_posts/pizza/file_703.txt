School is back up. Just getting over being sick, with whatever public school kids are brewing this year. Going to be a rainy week. Finally getting my daughter back again for a little bit after a long week at her moms. Already have some movies picked out. Was thinking of throwing a little pizza party for her. We can try to repay with artwork, pictures of our cat -- (he is stunning), and/or good deeds.


Daughter has been getting on here now that she reads pretty well, and was going to post from her account but it's less than a month and was too new. Even though she mostly just likes to get on here and upvote pictures from /r/owls. She's loving karma, but... Getting pizza'd on here would totally blow her mind. Personally, I could use seeing something nice from the world. Anyway, many thanks to any kind strangers that might come our way.
