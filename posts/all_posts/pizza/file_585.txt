Money is scarce this time of year. I've had a lot come up recently, including gallbladder removal. Since then, I haven't attempted fatty, greasy nor cheesy foods because I'd feared for the reaction my body may have, but I'm not sure what else I could request aside from pizza. Money is super tight at the moment and I just can't spare the money to purchase much in terms of food until Wednesday. I made a request on Monday that went without a response and I deleted it. I wasn't aware that was a bannable offense, but learned so from the RAOP chat! Just wanted to bring that to light!

Thank you for your consideration!!!
