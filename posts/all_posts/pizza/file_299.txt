Starting a personalized songwriting business. It's going to turn into a community for songwriters and listeners to interact and coordinate the creation of a personalized song. Ideally, it's going to forever close the gap between the songwriter and listener, and give struggling, talented songwriters an opportunity to bring happiness to anyone in need of a song, for anything; but I've got a lot of work to do before then.

I probably won't have enough for rent this month, but my landlord's anniversary is coming up and I'm writing a song for his wife, in exchange for letting me be a week late. This leaves the unfortunate angle of food. I'm all out of bread.

Instead of just asking for a pizza, let's make this a symbiotic relationship. I will write a song about whatever you want. (Literally.) It will be catchy, awesome, and recorded in the form of a high quality mp3, in exchange for a delicious ham and pineapple pizza. I'll even submit it to you before you send a pizza, if you're wary about the deal.

If you're interested in hearing about my business, I'm funding Step 1 through kickstarter.com. [Here's the link to that](http://kck.st/pgKaih) Back me, or send it to a friend you think might be interested in a personalized song. 

Otherwise, pizza for a song. Savvy?

Thanks!
