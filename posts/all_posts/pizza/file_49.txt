Basically don't have much cash for the next two weeks until the next part of my student grant comes in. 

Near the end of a massive design engineering project and it's getting pretty stressful. 

Not much in the cupboards and i've been eating rice and beans for the past few days. Thanks r/frugal.

Would love a tasty pizza and I'll pay back into the community once I get a bit more cash. 

Peace
