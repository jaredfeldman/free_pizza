A friend at work just told me about this site because she knows the situation I am in. I am a hard working mother of 4 who struggles from paycheck to paycheck. I get paid every two weeks and this week is a non pay week. I am flat broke and need help feeding my children.... my husband and i both will do without as long as my children can eat. I never miss a day at work but it never seems to be enough. My husband has been laid off and I am doing the best i can as a mother and wife to make it work. Any assistance at all will be more than appreciated.
