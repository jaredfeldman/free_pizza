Hi guys. Husband with lovely (and of course very nice) Canadian wife here. Lost my job recently and having trouble making ends meet with all of our funds tied up in lawyer and Federal fees for my wife's US citizenship. While I've been blessed with a loving wife and our loyal and hilarious pups, I cannot afford to provide them with anything special during this rough time - even after a humble holiday and stringent budgeting for groceries and supplies from the likes of Aldi and Dollar General. 

Truthfully, I'm ashamed to admit that I've failed so completely in being a good provider for my tiny family and I'm glad we decided to wait on having kids so they don't have to struggle with us. But I also have no illusions about this and I'm well-aware that the responsibility lies squarely in my hands. That said, I know how effective something as simple as a pizza would be in raising the spirits around here so I'm sucking it up and asking for help from a community I've valued for quite some time now.

My wife is vegetarian, so I would request a cheese pizza. My local Dominos is the cheapest I know of and has a coupon for an extra large 1-topping for $9.99 ($13.26 w/tax), which is actually better than the regular price of a large ($14.37 w/tax). There are various other coupons as well, from Dominos Store #2878.

Bonus: my wife would be more than happy to draw the subject of your choice in MSPaint!

**TL;DR**: currently failing at providing for family, humble request for a bit of cheesy sunshine through the clouds, MSPaint bounty offered.

No matter what happens or doesn't happen as a result of this request, I just want to express sincere thanks to everyone in this subreddit. The fact that this even exists is yet another testament to all of the good in this world and I can't wait to pay it forward!
