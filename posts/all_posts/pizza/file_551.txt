Hi there! It's one of those super cold, super crappy, super lazy days where all you want to do is curl up and watch a movie. My car is awful in the snow (which has already turned to slush, which will probably freeze soon...) so going to the supermarket is out. I seem to be running low on supplies so a pizza would be absolutely fantastic. No sad story, no dilemma, just a cold lady who would like to indulge.
