thanks for taking the time to read. due to medical circumstances(i work graveyard shifts, have hard time sleeping during the day, dental visits), i haven't been able to work the past week. therefore, i wont be getting a paycheck this week. i had just enough to scrape by my bills, and put enough gas in my car to get me to work and back this week so i can have a paycheck(finally) on the 20th. im usually ahead of the game/curve, pay my stuff early, etc. its just been a rough month.

if anyone feels like being generous, i only have one condition-let me do something in return. you name it(within reason) as long as it is very frugal in nature. i can write you a letter/card, valentines day card if you're a lady redditor. i can make pictures of my kitty. something along those lines. again, thanks for reading.
