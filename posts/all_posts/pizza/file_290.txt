It always hurts me to ask others for help. 
I'm at my fathers apartment right now. Today is his first day at a new job, thank the lord! Well, he left today and I don't know what time he will come home. His job is to help people move, so I doubt he'll be home anytime soon. He found this job after months of unemployment, so there's not much in our fridge other than cold franks. A hot pizza would really hit the spot for me right about now. I made this throw-away account because I have friends who frequent Reddit, and I would not want them to see me in despair. Thank you in advance, Reddit.

Tl;dr
Dad left for new job. At apartment alone. Nothing in fridge.
