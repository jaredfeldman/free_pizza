The title pretty much sums it up. 

I've recently moved back to the States from Italy. All my household items are on a large ship on their way over which means I don't have much to use for cooking in way of utensils. 

I'm not scrimping for pennies but I am being frugal till I figure out my means here (especially since I'm on the hunt for a job) so if the Pizza Fairy is waiting for someone truly in need then wait for another post!
