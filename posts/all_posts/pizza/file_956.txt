I just moved to Indianapolis while I take a semester off of college from Indiana State and I have no food or drink. I was supposed to get money dropped into my account today from a friend that owes me money from work I did for them but they had difficulties with their car. I'm just in a bad spot tonight so if I could get a pizza bro'd to me that would be great. I have a job interview at Marsh soon and I'll make sure to re-forward the kindness as soon as possible. Thanks reddit!
