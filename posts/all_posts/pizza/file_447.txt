All I have at home is a loaf of bread, since I was on vacation when the accident happened (as typical in Michigan, a deer decided to do a few cartwheels over the two-week old car).  Luckily insurance is covering the car, but since I don't have a credit/debit card, I had to pay the deposit in cash, depleting all my money until Friday when I get paid again. To make matters worse, the rental car they gave me is a baby blue Nissan Versa, which is embarrassing as hell to drive.

I am in Grand Haven, MI and was wondering if there was any way I could get just a basic pepperoni pizza.  The only chain places are Jets, Pizza Hut, and Dominoes (and Dominoes last I knew used one of those carbon copy things the driver carried for the CC since they demand the person with the card to be here).

I WILL pay it forward after I get paid on Friday.  I am just slightly sick of having toast and butter the past two days...
