My parents are on vacation and my sister left for the day, but forgot to leave some money for me to order a pizza or something like that. I'm too young to drive, (Maryland driving laws are blah) I was able to get enough change in quarters to make some sort of tip, but no where near enough to pay for a pizza. I have no cooking ability whatsoever, and a pizza sounds amazing.

However, although I don't have a credit card, I do have a saved one on steam, so I will trade any steam game(s) from $1-$15 (with some flexibility)
