I'm broke, unemployed, and my self-esteem is in the gutter. I could have it a lot worse -- I have a roof over my head, and I'm currently in school, finishing the prerequisites for a program I've dreamed of attending for years -- but to be honest, I'm pretty isolated right now, feel lonely, and pizza would make me feel better.

I hope to get a callback soon from one of the jobs I've applied for, so I can return the favor or pay it forward.
