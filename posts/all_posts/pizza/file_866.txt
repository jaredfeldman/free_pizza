I have nothing in particular to barter. I have no huge sob story. Im just a recexnt college's grad that is currently down on his luck. I am from Ft. Collins, CO and am a recent CSU graduate. Things are looking up for me. I passed the certification test to be a Pharmacy Technician so hopefully i can get a job soon. In the mean time, the generosity of a redditor is currently the only way im going to be able to eat today/.tomorrow. Thanks in advance regardless of the outcome of this.
