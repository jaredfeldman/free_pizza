Hi Reddit!


First off, I'd like to say I love this subreddit. I visit every now and again to see kindness toward strangers and it always makes me feel good ^_^ Even the supporters with upvotes make me smile. Keep it up, bros!


I'm asking for a pizza because I've moved to a new town recently and after a month of tedious job searching, I've finally managed to find a fulltime position (yay me!) but ... it took a month and I don't start working until tomorrow with my payday being at least a week away. If a kind stranger could throw some food my way, I'd be very appreciative!


In return, I give one of my favourite Internet reads

http://www.omegleconversations.com/urinate-in-catless-peace.html

and also my steam name: [eiramasil] and SC2 information [eira.506] because I'd love to be able to game with anyone who helps me out.


Thanks and have a great week ~
