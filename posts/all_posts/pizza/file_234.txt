The front page brought me here. I'm in a bit of a tight spot where I have to wait for my paycheck to clear...which is still two days away. I ran out of food yesterday and all I have to eat is a bag of snack size bits &amp; bites a friend gave me. I'm down to 6 packs =|

Any help is immensely appreciated.
