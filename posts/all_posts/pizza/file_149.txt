My mother and father's business of 20 years tanked last year and they've been struggling ever since. I live with my mother, and my two younger sisters in house that we can no longer afford to keep. We're moving into my grandparents house next weekend. Apart from my mother's disability checks, I am my immediate family's only source of income. I work part-time and make about 100 bucks a week.   
  
If someone would be kind enough to hook us up with a pizza it would be much appreciated! :)
