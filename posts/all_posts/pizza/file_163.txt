to post on this again, as the first time I asked I told my story of little money no food for a few weeks someone screamed at me and told me to manage my money a little better, I was startled and scared hell I was even ashamed so I took it down...I'm new to reddit, I can only use it while borrowing a friends comp....so I don't have much of a history, but I don't really know where else to go, I'm not so bad off as in I have enough ramen to last me and my fiance a pack a day for a week, but we've been eating it for a while and would love a hot pizza, if you can help it would be appreciated, if not thanks for looking. thank you.
