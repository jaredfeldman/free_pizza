I can't find it in me to use my normal account, so this is a throwaway; 

long story short, my boss was upset at something I did and thus i'm unemployed for the time being; my kids are hungry and all I ask is for them to be fed. i don't need any food, just my kids. if anyone could help, i'd be grateful. thanks :)

the nearest food pantry is too far for us, my insurance has expired and i can't risk the drive
