If anyone could help me and my girlfriend out it would be amazing and we would pay it forward when we get back on our feet.
Both unemployed at the moment in a new city. We have managed to cover rent and bills for the month, but at the expense of nice food and quality of life.
ANY type of nice food would go a long way if anyone can help us out and will repay the favour to other worthy redditors ASAP.
