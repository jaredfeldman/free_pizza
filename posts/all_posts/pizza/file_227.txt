A few weeks ago my head gasket unexpectedly warped and repairs wrecked my savings for the summer. I had been prepared to remain unemployed until I return to school in the Fall, but at the moment I'm operating on a shoestring budget and scrambling for jobs. I've been able to pay my rent, utilities, and internet, and buy cheap staples like eggs and PB&amp;J stuff. Ever since I repaired my car, my boyfriend and I have been applying for jobs diligently, 5 or 6 a day, but yesterday my check engine light came on after some trouble accelerating from a stop sign. I haven't driven it again and I'm at my wits' end. I wouldn't have repaired the head gasket initially, except we don't live near enough to grocery stores where our food stamps stretch the whole month to live without a car. In the meantime...we'd just love a slice. Additionally, when I get my first paycheck in the Fall - sometime in October - I will PM you, and buy you pizza. I am a man of my word. I also plan to frequent this subreddit after every payday from now on because I honestly never thought I'd be here. Thanks, Reddit. :)

Edit: I'm in Southern Oregon. Is there something else I should include?
