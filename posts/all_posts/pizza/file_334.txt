I posted yesterday but a very nice lady from work knew I was having some financial trouble and got us food for last night. So I deleted my request. Today we are back in the same boat. Like I stated yesterday, this is out of my comfort zone because I am usually the one trying to help somebody. My husband was laid off about 3 months ago and we usually are able to make it from check to check. I also take care of my Grandmother how is disabled. But this week has been rough. My car broke down on Tuesday. Had to get a new battery and a couple of other small parts to get it back running. This set us back. We are now Broke. We are going to try to have a yard sale tomorrow to get up a little money but have nothing for tonight. I am more than willing to pay this forward when I get paid again next Friday July 15. Thanks for your consideration.
