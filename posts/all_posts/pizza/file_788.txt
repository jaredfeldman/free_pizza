Broke ass-college student here; got paid 10 days ago and all of my paycheck went to rent and bills. I've got no groceries in the house and all my roommates are back home for the summer. No gas in the car and the bike's out of commission :(. If any kind redditor could hook me up I'd be able to eat for two days :D

EDIT: oh, and of course: I'll be pizzaing it forward when my paycheck comes next month. this is a ridiculously cool subreddit.
