I am a 22 year old man with a job that doesn't pay extremely well and does not offer insurance.  A full hospital visit is not an option for me financially, so my only options are walk in clinics.  I recently started feeling some severe abdominal pain and ended up going to the clinic two times before it was determined I had a blockage.  I am happy to be feeling much better, but that broke me and I have officially run out of money for food.  I would appreciate a pizza today more than you know.  I would be happy to buy someone in need a pizza this Friday once I get my paycheck.  Thank you
