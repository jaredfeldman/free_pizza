My foodstamps come in on the 8th and I have 13 dollars of it left. It would be nice to have some piece of mind for a night. I don't really want to broadcast my life and what is going on but if you would like to know for some legitimacy I can tell you. I just need some cheering up and have someone nice to come along to keep my faith up.

-Edit-
I'm in Lakewood/Denver CO area
