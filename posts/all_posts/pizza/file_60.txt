This hurts my pride to beg like this, but the position I am in leaves me with few options and hungry. I have my daughter with me and I'm flat broke with not much food in the house besides a couple cans of black beans and peanut butter; nothing I'd constitute as a meal. To anyone that is feeling generous enough to send a pizza my way it would be appreciated beyond words. I thought this would be worth a shot.
