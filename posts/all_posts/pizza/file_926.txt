I'm a graduate filmmaking student at Montana State University in an MFA program. I'm currently working as an equipment technician on a series being produced for Discovery Channel. However, the company I actually work for is based out of the UK and getting my first paycheck has been quite a long time coming, as paperwork and such takes awhile to go back and forth. I'm currently down to $2.00 in my bank account.

I am expecting to get my first paycheck next week and will gladly re-visit this board to pay the pizza forward and buy one for someone else who needs it. 

Thanks for listening. :)

EDIT: ReillyBoy helped me enjoy a delicious pizza from Dominoes and went even further. She has reminded me that generosity is alive and well in a time when selfishness seems to have run amok.
