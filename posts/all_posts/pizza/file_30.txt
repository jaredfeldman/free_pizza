Of all the forums I've seen on here, this one is the most interesting, most interactive, and the most uplifting. 

Need some of that right about now. I think I sprained my ankle because I was scared I was going to be late to work. I was three minutes early. Then I got laid off.
My wife has a reliable job, but it's only meant for secondary income. Grocery day is on Friday, but we have to start cutting back and saving as soon as we can. We probably won't have pizza for a while so if anyone can help us and the kids out, it'd be great. I can't promise to pay it back on a certain day, but I will do it as soon as I can.

Off to the fun world of resume writing....

Thank you all for doing what you do and for reading my post!
