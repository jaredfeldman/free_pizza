Thanks in advance RAOP. As the title says, I'll be graduating on the 4th with my bachelor's! Hooray! In the meantime though, I'm broke as all hell due to moving expenses. Could you buy me a papa johns pizza here in tempe?

Thanks again RAOP! When I get my job, I promise my first check will be spent buying pizza for people here on the board :D
