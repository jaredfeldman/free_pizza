Hello. This is my novelty account in place of my real 2-year one. People have quickly forgotten about this masterpiece of a book. I decided not to perpetuate anything to do with Palin anyway.

I've never asked the internet for assistance, so be gentle with me. I live in Austin and I don't have too much longer on my degree. I had a work-study job, but since I'm not taking summer classes, I don't anymore. I have $4 to get me through the week. If some nice guy or gal could send a pizza my way, I'd be blown away. Two mediums could feed me for 3 days

As a token of my gratitude, I could send you a picture of me and said pizza or write a paragraph for you in an interesting foreign language (which I will keep secret for now ;) ). 

Thank you.
