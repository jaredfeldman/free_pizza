Hey! My mother's AWOL, and I have no money; the oven's broken, and I'm feeling pretty depressed. I don't want to have to eat a bread-and-butter sandwich for dinner again tonight, and I'd really like a random act of pizza.

Would anyone feel kind enough to buy me a pizza/give me a gift card/code? As stated in the title, I'm in the United Kingdom.

Even if not,

I love you, Reddit. Every single one of you.
