Recently, I had to file an extension for my U.I. but my payments ended up getting delayed from it and was force to overdraft a cheque to pay for rent. Thankfully, I'm getting the payments by next week and some incoming gigs(barbacking) by Wednesday. Until then, I only have a few dollars and a supply of ramen. If anyone is willing to make my day by sending me pizza. I would be more then grateful for the random act of kindness.  I have a RAOP verification code if needed.
