Well the ticket is IMO total bs (it looks like I come to a full stop to me in the little grainy video) but I have to pay it, according to the ticket I did not come to a complete stop while making a right on red. Pretty crappy mood about it and was poor before having to pay it. Pizza is my comfort food. Also there's that email from PJ's that says if I order more than $10 I'll get 25 papa points, that would make this week not so shitty. I thank anyone for considering my request.
