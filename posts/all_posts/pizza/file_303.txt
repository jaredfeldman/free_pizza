Ok, so I feel super weird doing this, but our week could really use a bright spot. I'm a single Dad of three of the greatest junior geeks you could ask for. After a week filled with bad news, we decided tonight we're all just going to huddle up together in the living room and watch Back to the Future and I would love to surprise them with pizza. 

I'm willing to offer up any verification you would like, and of course verify with a thank you post and PM to the mods.

We're not going to starve without the pizza, so if you see someone nerdier, please help them first. But if you can spare, it would bring some major smiles to my home. Thanks for reading this!

Edit: Blerg...that should have said needier above, not nerdier. I'm not sure you will find nerdier people. :-)
