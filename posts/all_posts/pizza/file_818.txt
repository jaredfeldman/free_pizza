EDIT: THANK YOU SO MUCH To Piccolittle for sending me a pizza, it is truly appreciated and was a wonderfully kind act.

As the title says.. my birthday was terrible. Saw a grand total of 3 people in my family, only one of which actually remembered it was my birthday.. Asked my mum to do one thing for me, which was to not drink on my birthday.. and she was drinking when I got there at lunchtime.  Another member of my family demanded to know why I was upset that they hadn't remembered it was my birthday. -.-  Unemployed too, so money is super tight.. would absolutely love a pizza right now. Thanks.
