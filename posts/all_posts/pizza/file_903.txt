Hello! I come to this site looking for a little help getting through a little bit of a tough time. I'm just getting over being sick as a dog. Shingles aren't pretty. I had a few sick days, but I was out for a bit longer than I thought I'd be, so my check is going to be a little short. A pizza dinner would be great. This isn't a real need, but my expecting wife has been craving pizza and my son is doing really well in school. We are a small family and don't need much. We'll pay it back when I can catch up in a few weeks.

Thank you!
