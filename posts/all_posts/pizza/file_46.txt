I'm sure there are needier people on this subreddit, but I had to borrow 30 bucks to pay the rest of my share of rent yesterday and now I'm broke until next friday.  Pizza for me and my housemate that lent me the 30 bucks would be much appreciated for dinner.  Thanks in advance, it's subreddits like this that make Reddit such an awesome place.
