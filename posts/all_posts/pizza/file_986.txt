I'm in the middle of a divorce. I'm picking my kids up tonight after work for their week with me. I only get paid once a month and pizza is off the menu because of that. I've got ramen and frozen hotdogs and such for the rest of the week, but I'd love for my boys to have something exciting on their first night with me. 
Thanks RAOP!
