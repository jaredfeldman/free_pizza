So a fellow redditor kept me company last night when I was stricken with stress induced insomnia. I never made it to sleep and had to be at work at 7:30. Spent 2 hours this afternoon in the Department of Social Services office trying to see if I qualified for any assistance. Tomorrow I will go on the 30 day processing list for SNAP, they accepted a medicaid application for me and my daughter, and put me on the 2 year waiting list for daycare assistance. I picked her up from daycare and brought her home to give her a bath and as we were filling up the tub I noticed it looked dirty. Then it looked really dirty and red. I stopped the water and got her out of the tub and checked all of our faucets. All had icky brownish red water coming out of them. Needless to say, I'm not cooking tonight and am waiting for the utility company to call me back. Would anyone like to send a pizza to Wilmington, NC to cheer up my 4 year old who thought she took a bath in blood?
