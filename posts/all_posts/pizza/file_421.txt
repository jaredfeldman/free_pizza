Pizza is my feel better food, but I'm low on cash right now. Last night I broke up with my live-in boyfriend of 2 years because I found out that he had been interacting with his ex in a way that was less than desirable. I don't really feel like going in to the details because I'm still processing everything. This is the worst I've ever felt in my life and I just want to curl up with a pizza and have a good cry.
