Honestly, I didn't want to come down to this and request a pizza, but I haven't ate anything all day but rice. Finals are coming up for my summer session and I would appreciate a pizza to cheer me up. If you can't I completely understand I plan to give back once I get a paycheck. I'm located in New Jersey. Thanks for everything.
