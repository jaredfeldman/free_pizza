i just lost my job tonight due to not having a completely open flexibility because im taking 18 credit hours this summer. only reason im even doing that is to meet my goal of getting my AA in less than a year after graduating highschool. im really hungry and have no money. studying for exams, and depressed. please send me a pizza to make me happy and when i get some money i'll paint you something and send it back as a thanks. &lt;3
