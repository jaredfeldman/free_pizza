Hello everyone,

This is my first time here, I have just heard about it and decided to give it a shot since I have little food.

I live in Kent, WA and we just had a really big snowstorm which put my apartment out of power for 5 days, as well as about 400,000 other homes. I have already been struggling and what little food I had frozen has now been spoiled, even the milk in my refridgerator. I live pay check to pay check and I did not anticipate this, I do not even have the money to purchase a gallon of milk.

I was hoping one of the kind souls out there could gift me a pizza that I could enjoy with my son, it would really help so much as all we have is about 6 cup of noodles and 2 boxes of Mac and cheese (with no milk) to make it until payday this Friday.

If somebody could help me out I would be so happy, pizza from anywhere, it doesn't matter... Just something to eat.

I would gladly repay the favor forward when I get paid and gift somebody else in need.

Thank you for listening,
Mikey
