I just recently moved out on my own and things are tough. I was laid off 2 weeks ago and now I am feeling the pain. I am going to be really behind on rent and I've had to cut costs. The biggest impact was groceries and gasoline. I can't afford to go anywhere. I haven't had meat and I am SUFFERING. I have been relying on rice and steamed vegetables for the past two weeks. Pizza would be a blessing right now.
