I hope I posted the title correctly. I've been unemployed for most of the year, and I will be starting a new job in 2 weeks. I'm very excited about this new position, however I won't be receiving my first check for another month. My son has been my rock through it all and he continues to grow into a wonderful young man. I know this pizza would mean the world to him as it would be a vast improvement from what we've been eating. Would anyone out there be willing to help me surprise my son with a good meal? Please consider us. Thank you.
