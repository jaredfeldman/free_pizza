Hi, I've ran out of food and I don't have any money to buy food until I get paid tomorrow. Please can a kind redditor order a pizza for me from dominos.co.uk .If you pay by credit/debit card I can walk to dominos 30 minutes away to collect it. £5.99 is the cheapest pizza. If you can only use paypal, you will need to order a more expensive pizza at least £8.99 and they have to deliver it to me. I have £3.20 in my paypal account I can send you. If you are kind enough to buy me one please pm me for my details. I will be forever grateful. I'm from Scotland, UK. The name of the pizza is below.
