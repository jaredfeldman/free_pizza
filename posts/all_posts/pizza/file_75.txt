So after being a year and 4 months clean off of a serious opiate addiction, i started realizing alcohol was starting to take over my life.  checking myself into rehab on thursday and will be there for the next 60 days.  not trying to gain sympathy for that, as most will say that being in this position is my fault.  but nonetheless, i'm broke, and want to eat some pizza.  would love to return the favor when i get out. 

 i'm a 22 year old male in texas in case anyone wanted to know. thanks :)
