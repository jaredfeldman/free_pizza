So, I haven't been able to keep anything but crackers down for a while now, and nothing has sounded good to me.

But I woke up today, and all I could think about was how damned good a pizza sounded. Except I'm broke until Thursday.

So, if someone is feeling generous, I'd absolutely love a simple pepperoni pizza.

I have a verification code, if that sways anyone's decision?
