Here is why today sucks:

-Guy I've been seeing for a little over a month socked me in the face last night, so that's over.

-Can't find a fucking job.

-Roommates just ditched on us after eating our food and not paying bills... because they found a better place.

-Don't get foodstamps refilled until the 9th.

-Totally coming down with something.

Damn it, I would love someone forEVER if I got pizza'd. I'm in New Orleans. The only thing close-ish to me that delivers is Domino's.

Le sigh.
