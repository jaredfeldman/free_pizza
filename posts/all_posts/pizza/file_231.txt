I'm just really hungry and I've got no money right now. Been unemployed for 6 months but just got a real great job offer at a consulting firm in berkeley. so i'd like to do something special to celebrate but i'm in the red right now.

after jan 2nd i will be employed with a well paying job and will definitely pay it forward.

I'm stoked!
