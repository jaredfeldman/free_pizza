Hello friends!  I just got back from classes and I really don't feel like cooking tonight.  I was going to order a Papa Johns pizza but I just bought gas and can't really afford it right now.  Would anyone be so kind?  I have a gift-able copy of portal on steam if some kind individual would like it :)

Also I'm fairly new (previous lurker) to reddit and I heard about RAOP, you folks are doing FSM's work.
