My next paycheck wont come til friday the 16th.  Until then I have exactly $12.88 in my account to get gas to get me to work and food.  A pizza could easily feed me for 3+ days :)  I had an unexpected illness which left me out of work for some time and my job does not compensate for sick time.  Anyone willing to help a guy out?  I will be sure to pay it forward when I get back on my feet financially!
