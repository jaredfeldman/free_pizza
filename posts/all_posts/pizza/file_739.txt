Lost my job in December.  I've been actively looking for a new one.  Worked as a security guard for a week before getting laid off.  Been going to interviews but still no positions yet.

I've completely run out of money and am basically stuck in my house, saving what little gas I have left for pursuing job prospects.  I've been eating through the last of my ramen during this past week or so and slowly depleting my reserve of oatmeal.

If anyone could send a pepperoni pizza, I'll be sure to keep the pizza-karma flowing once I land on my feet.

I'm also completely open to repaying the pizza favor with some non-money related favor, just let me know what you need.
