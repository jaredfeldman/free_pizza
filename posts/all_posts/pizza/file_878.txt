I don't get paid until next Friday, and the last packet of ramen was used for dinner a few nights ago. I've got pickle juice and mayonnaise in the refrigerator and I'm not sure even sure if the mayo is any good... A hot meal would be majorly appreciated.

Edit: I forgot to mention that when I get paid, I'll return the favour. It'll just be a week.
