[EDIT] GREAT SUCCESS. Thanks @ Choppersb!

Hey all, I'm a student in graphic design who just finished his summer quarter and portfolio only to be left with no money for the next week. My philadelphian ass would kill for a pizza or even a slice of bread at this point. I get paid the first of the month, but with an empty fridge and cupboard, I'll end up eating my toenails in the mean time.

If you can help me out, I'll be sure to pass the kindness along come the first--Ill even keep a donate(r) in the loop so that they can see the chain reaction ;)

OMNOMNOM !
