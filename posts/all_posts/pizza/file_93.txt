I have no monies at the current moment until I sell my minivan for 2500. I hope it sells for 2500. Until such a time I am lacking food. A nice peperoni pie would be wonderful if anyone is so inclined. 

I will return the favor and come here and buy someone a nice box of goodness once my van sells. 

I have just fallen on bad times, I have poof of my lack of funds if that is needed. 

I forgot to tell my location in the title, I am currently stuck in the Panhandle of Florida.  

*Edit: Looks like I can not make a complete sentence. Oh well that is life.* 

*Edit 2: Nazoth gave me some Pizza, well gave me a gift card. Live so far out, delivery isn't an option. That explains the odd sounds I hear at night. I swear it might be an Ood. I shall ride into town in my blue minivan to pick me up a nice pie. I'll be sure to share the love once said ride is sold, in order to keep folks with some pizza. Everyone likes Pizza*
