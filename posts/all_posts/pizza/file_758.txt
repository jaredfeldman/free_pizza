So I've fallen on some really hard times, and I've never done something like this, but after reading through some of the posts on here, I was taken aback at the kindness of the community, so I figured I'd give it a whirl.

I'm a 24 year old guy, living with two roommates that I absolutely loathe, unemployed for the past 5 months, busting my back looking for a job, and reaching the end of both my money and sanity.

I've been "borrowing" food from my roommates for a couple weeks now, but I hate having to go to them for anything, so I've been relegated to ramen and pickles.  If you've never tried them together, do yourself a favor and DON'T.

So, if someone had the urge and would be willing to help me out, if even for a day, I would be incredibly grateful and appreciative.

Thanks everyone
