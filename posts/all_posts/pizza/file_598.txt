My name is Jonathan. My mother and I receive food stamps in the state of Arizona. We get them on the 7th of every month. Normally they last but this month we had some trouble stretching them out. Today is the 6th and we have no food left in the house and we are just one day away from receiving our food stamps. Enough for one pizza for tonight would be great. That's all we need. We'd appreciate your help. We can give any verification that would be needed.
