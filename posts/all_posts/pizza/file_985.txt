Hey there RAoP.
Rae here.
Longtime lurker, first time poster.
I moved to New York State about a month ago, and have been on the job hunt since like, day one. Now, I've finally managed to get myself a job, but it doesn't start until next thursday, and I've got just enough money left in my account for laundry and my phone bill, so until then I'm bumming off of my roommates for food, which I have been for the last two weeks.

There are a whole mess of really great Pizza places within walking distance of my apartment, and I'd really like to get a pie to share with my roommates, as thanks for putting me up for so long.
