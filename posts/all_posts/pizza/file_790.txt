My SO is the only one working right since I'm still looking for work. He has spent all of the money on bills and the hell hole apartment and now we are both sitting around trying to figure out what to do for food. We have tried to find people on Craigslist to buy our backwards compatible hacked PS3 but the only replies we got were from scams. In short, a pizza sounds so good right now and it sure can raise our hope and morale too. Please Reddit, a pizza pie for two hungry people?
