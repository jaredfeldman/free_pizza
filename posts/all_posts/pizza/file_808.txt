Hey everyone! When you're desperately trying to stay out of debt like I am bills often come before food and you find yourself with a roof over your head, but nothing in your stomach. I'm new here and am hoping to cash in some karma points to fill my belly. I will GLADLY post pictures of myself enjoying aforementioned delicious pizza. Help me internet! You're my only hope :) Thanks in advance
