Hey all,

My life is in the gutter right now.  I've been trying to find a job while trying to take night classes, but neither are working out very well at this point.

I've got a little bit of my reserves left, but that has to last me for the unforeseeable future, and I don't know when or where my next job will come from.

I know it may sound a little sad, but I've forgotten what pizza tastes like, it's been so long since I've had any.  And being transplanted from Chicago, this is not a good feeling.

Anyone have it within themselves to help me out?
