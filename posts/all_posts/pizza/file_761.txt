My son has recieved his meal, thanks veritas27!

My son is in dire need, I'm from Central California, a mother of 5, and cash is really tight here at home. My oldest child joined the Army in December of 09, he had just turned 19 then, however during his training at Ft. Benning he substained a back injury and was medically released from the service in Aug. 2010. It happen 2 weeks before his graduation he was on his last phase, I had bought my non refundable airline tickets a few days before that had happened. He came home and literally had to be on his back for 6 months, we didnt have the money nor insurance for him to get proper treatment, nor was there any offered to him by the Army, he toughed it out but he fell into deep depression.. by Feb. this year, he started training himself in shape, and began looking for any work, unfortunately nothing came up, that only lead to him feeling more depressed, having to see his dad work long hours at a very labor job to support all of us, he couldnt bare it and decided to take a chance in another state, hes in Portland, OR. right now, with his cousin, still trying to establish himself there, he's been there for about a month struggling, he just got a mailing address and now he can get an Oregon ID, right now he just haves his military ID, he doesnt except any cash from me, cause he says he rather it go to the babies (his little sisters 5 and 6) I worry about him eating constintly, instead i dried some cheap beef to jerky, and boxed some ramens to him. My son is struggling to get something started, I pray that something good will happen for him, and I think that something like this, would lift his spirits, that someone was thinking of him..
