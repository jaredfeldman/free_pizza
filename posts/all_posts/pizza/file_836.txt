I was cut off by my parents a couple months ago because I've been fighting depression and they didn't like my behavior. Since then I've been struggling to finish school while blowing through my savings because of my nasty eating habit till they ran out at the end of the school year and have been living off the generosity of my gf since I picked up 2 jobs and worked 12 hours today but I haven't worked long enough to be paid. We're both broke and hungry and neither of us have eaten today (it's 9:30 here) and I need food so I can work more tomorrow!!! Once I have paychecks coming in I'll pay it forward. Thank you!!
