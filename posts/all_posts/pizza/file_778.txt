Hey guys I've been without stable income for a couple months now and have eaten nothing but ramen for 2 weeks. Any money I end up scraping together goes to my rent so I'm not couch surfing. I was just wondering if anyone would be able to help me out here. Ramen is ok but it makes me want to hurl after a while. Here is my bank account http://imgur.com/WW08gM5  I don't know if ill be able to provide anyone with any in the near future but if someone could help me out that would be great and if not that is fine to. Thank you for your time.
