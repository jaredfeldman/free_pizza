Hey all, just want to tell someone about my breakthrough. I had a drinking problem for a long time and decided to do something about it. Today I had my first meeting and it really helped talking about it. I'm kind of in a bad place right now financially and quitting the booze is the best thing right now. If anyone could help out with some pizza I would really appreciate helping me take my mind off the booze and money problem. Thanks all.

Thanks to Gary for helping me through this tough time. It really made my day brighter.
