I have been unemployed for about six months and recently my dog has had numerous health issues that have led to thousands of dollars in vet bills. I have fallen behind on my mortgage in order to help try and save her. She is slowly doing better but still needs daily medications that I am struggling to pay for. I know to many people it may seem crazy to sacrifice so much for a dog, but she really is my baby. I would appreciate a pizza to help give me some comfort during this difficult time, as I have no family near me either. Thanks for your consideration.
