My friend Kate is one of the most talented special education teachers I have ever met and is an expert on assistive technology (namely communication devices). She gives voices to many people and has made the lives of countless individuals and their families better through her dedication and relentless work as an educator. She also happens to be the unluckiest person I've ever met - she currently has a broken foot, a uterine tumor, diabetes, a broken car all on top of being broke from student loans and medical expenses. 

She posted a status on facebook tonight that said "At home 3 days with a broken foot, a broken down car and the bank still hasn't sent me a new debit card. Anyone who wants to pay to order me a pizza is welcome to, I can't take anymore Ramen. On the upside I get new X-rays tomorrow and maybe they can figure out why it hurts so much. And my car should be fixed by noon tomorrow." and I immediately thought of you guys at r/R_A_O_P and hope you are willing to help me help her out and let her know that the world isn't always out to rain on her parade. She is located in Massachusetts and I can provide proof if necessary (I'm kind of new to how r/R_A_O_P works so forgive me if I'm doing this wrong)
