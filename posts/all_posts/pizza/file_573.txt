Hey guys. Title pretty much says it all. I was supposed to get paid today (1st and 3rd Friday) but my anal retentive senior Asian boss says he doesn't have to pay me till Monday (closed Sunday).

I'm not starving to death right now or anything but I could really use some food for the sake of work tomorrow. If not thanks a lot for what everyone does anyway. I'll pizza it forward as soon as I can either way. 

PM for my info if you can. (U.S.)

*edit* forgot to mention had to put my jingles into my gas tank today to get to work. Hence the brokeness.
