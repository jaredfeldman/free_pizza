Hey all,

I'm the youth mission group leader at my Church, and they've spent the last two weeks working with Habitat for Humanity and other groups around the area to help out the community, and I would love to surprise them tonight with a nice tasty treat.

Anyone willing to help out some kids who were just giving back to their community?

Thanks and god bless
