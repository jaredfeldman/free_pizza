Hey RAOP, I'm college student living with a couple friends right now. After having about a dollar in my bank account for about 4 weeks I finally started working last week and will get paid on Friday. Unfortunately we are running out of food, and a pizza sounds just wonderful right about now. If anyone out there is willing to help us out, we'd be forever grateful! :)
