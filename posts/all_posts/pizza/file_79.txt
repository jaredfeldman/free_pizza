Hi RAOP, there are some great offers up right now but most don't seem to be drawing for a few days. That's nice but by tomorrow morning I'll actually be able to grab some bare essentials like milk, eggs, bread, and cereal. I was just wondering if somebody could help me out because my only option here is to heat a can of tomato puree. 

EDIT: I'm in the northern suburbs of Chicago.
