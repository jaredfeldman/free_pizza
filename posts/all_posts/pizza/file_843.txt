Hi. My girlfriend told me about Reddit and random acts of pizza. I still can't believe there is people this generous out there. I need a hand with the food for my daughter's birthday party. I am a single mom of 3 kids, ages 6 months, 3 years, and 7 years. I am throwing a small party this Saturday, Oct 29th and my daughter requested pizza for supper and I'm not sure I can afford pizza for all her guests (10 girls) I would appreciate any help offered! Verification can be provided.
