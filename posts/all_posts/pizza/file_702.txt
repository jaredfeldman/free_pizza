So i've been descending the winding staircase of heroin addiction over the past couple months, but i've finally taken steps to save myself from myself. I deleted my dealers numbers and got a withdrawal survival kit going (water, toilet paper, and some bud) but between that and my debts from using I'm flat broke. It didn't matter yesterday since between the puking and shitting i didnt exactly have time to eat, but now I feel like I can finally stomach something. I'm suffering through a day at work right now but I get home around 7, and there's a dominoes down the road...im through getting high with a lil help from my friends, but can anyone help me get by? i sincerely thank anyone who even considers helping me out, you (hopefully) have no idea how alone i feel dealing with this self inflicted hell 

edit: one more thing, on the off chance anyone end up wanting to help either tonight or tomorrow afternoon, my doorbell doesnt work so if possible tell the delivery dude to give a quick shout at the 2nd floor front window, trust me ill be lying right there in bed the whole time. or, if its easier, i can pm my philanthropist hero my cell number so the delivery guy/gal can just call me
