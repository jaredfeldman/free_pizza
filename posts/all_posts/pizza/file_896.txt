~~~I have no income whatsoever, and my husband is on SSI, paying for my rent and his on a fixed income. With bills and rent, we come out with $8 total for the rest of the month. My food card does not come in till the 9th, and we may not have enough food to last until then. A pizza would greatly lift our spirits, and if someone did donate one, once I have an income again we would be glad to do the same in return. We've already been trolled once today, please don't get our hopes down a second time..~~~
