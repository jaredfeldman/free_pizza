I have been working for about a month now at my new job, and yesterday was my first paycheck. Instead of mailing ME my paycheck, they accidentally sent it to some random address in pennsylvania, and now I have to wait until next week when they can void my previous check and then mail me another one, since its "company policy" to not have paychecks sent to where I work. If someone can please help me with a pizza I would be eternally grateful, I am at my wits end, and I could really use a hot meal. Please someone help me out!
