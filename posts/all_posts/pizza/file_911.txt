Work has been really crazy these past few weeks. I'm pretty sure the summer heat is making everyone possessed because I was literally running through the clinic today. I just got home and I have to work a 6th shift tomorrow because a coworker fucked up. If one more person cries on the phone with me I might scream.

Additionally, vet techs and assistants in American make a median wage of $24k a year. With my student loans, it barely gets me by each month. 

Hook a tired lady who had to touch poop all day up with a pizza? 


Edit: I'm a VETERINARY technician.
