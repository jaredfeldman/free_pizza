I have very little in the bank right now, only make enough to actually pay my rent, and have almost no food in my house. Didn't get to spend much time with my family this year. I'm an out-of-state student so I didn't even actually get to go home and have been here job hunting. None of my roommates are in town so I've been by myself for a while. Can anyone help a girl out? I would be infinitely grateful!

Also, I'm not really sure how this works, have never requested anything before. If you would like me to PM you anything else I would be more than happy to. Just don't want to put a lot of personal information for all to see. :/ Thank you so much. This community is the greatest.
