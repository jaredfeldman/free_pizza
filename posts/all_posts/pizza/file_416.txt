  For the past months since I've been home from college my family's living situation has gone from bad to terrible.  My mom has been in and out work for even longer, and its been difficult to keep food in the home. Along with my Dad skipping out of child support payments and bills looming it hasn't been easy.  

 Me and my brother have been basically eating fried rice and beans for the last few weeks and could really use a decent meal like a hot fresh pizza.
