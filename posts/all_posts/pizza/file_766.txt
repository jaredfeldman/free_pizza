recently i lost my job and my apartment and because i moved to another state i cannot collect unemployment the person i was supposed to move in with backed out after i got here and now i'm stuck in the walmart parking lot with a popped front passenger tire without any money or food i haven't eaten in several days and i have nobody who i can call for help. recently i saw this site by chance and decided that it can't hurt to try. all i need is a little help thank you and god bless
