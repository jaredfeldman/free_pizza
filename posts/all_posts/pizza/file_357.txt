this is my first time on this site, but i thought i should give it a try because i am really struggling. my husband of 4 years walked out on me and the kids almost a month ago. he got a new job and just up and left. we had a joint bank account and that all that has been feeding me and the kids, but now he transferred most of the money out of it and we have nothing. i was a stay at home mom, but now i am looking for a job so that me and my kids can get toiletries and basic supplies. my parents are still in the picture, but they dont understand why i dont try to reconnect with my husband, who i havent even spoke to and cannot find. they sent my children diapers, but im low on those now. all i am looking for is pizza for tonight it would make my kids day and cheer them up. there dad was a good man at one time and my kids still love him. they miss him and dont understand why he left. i couldnt bear to tell them the truth so i said he went on a trip. please somebody help us out with dinner for tonight.
