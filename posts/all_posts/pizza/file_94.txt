So, I overdrew my account paying rent, and then I got the overdraft fee. So I'm like doubly overdrawn. I have training for a job on Saturday but like, payday won't be till Thursday. I have one thing of easy mac left in the cabinet, maybe some pasta, but man, I am so stressed out. Hook a stupid kid up with a cheese pizza? Would totally rock my weekend. If you wanted to go crazy, barbecue chicken pizza, but hey a large cheese pizza would feed me for a while, like 4 meals. I'm batting my eyelashes here. Thanks for hearing me out.
