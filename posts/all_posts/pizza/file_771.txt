Hi amazing people! I've known of this subreddit's existence for awhile now, but have never participated. I guess now is the time, even though I'm on the other side of where I'd like to be. Currently, I'm very very hungry. I have no groceries in the house and unfortunately am going to have to wait until Thursday after 2pm (payday) to buy groceries again. I know that I could make a pizza last until then. If one of you guys could help me out, I'd be forever greatful! I'll even draw you a picture! I'm not an artist, but it's the thought that counts, right? I also pledge to return the favor sometime in the next three weeks! I have to give myself a little wiggle room because bills. Tons of bills. 

Edit: I can definitely provide proof of my empty fridge and bank account!
