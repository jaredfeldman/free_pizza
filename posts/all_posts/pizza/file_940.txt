I had posted a request in food pantry and it was suggested maybe to come here. I just was needing help for tomorrow, I will be able to shop on Tuesday. It's just me and 3 kids and yes I'm new and I know that's frowned upon. If you can help I can send you the money back this week. If you can't help please don't be mean, I'm not used to having to ask for help and it's hard for me.
