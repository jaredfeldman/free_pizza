Hi, I'm a new redditor(?). I'm sitting at my friend's house enjoying his A/C, and none of us have any money or food until Friday. He told me about this forum and said he never had any luck, but I think I'm luckier. I don't have a sad story or anything, we're just hungry and poor!

And I'll draw you an epic stick-figure battle if you get us some pizza!
