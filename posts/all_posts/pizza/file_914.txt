My roommate and I have both just moved into a new apartment recently and are hurting financially post-holiday/move. We would love if someone could forward us a pizza- Friday is payday and I will gladly return the favor. We also have a very hungry cat that won't get off my keyboard.

Thanks! We're in Austin, in case you wanted to creep.
