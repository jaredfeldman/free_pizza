**Miami, FL**

I've never tried this RaoP before, but I thought I'd give it a shot. I've had a shitty week at work, burnt myself trying to cook, and in the end I couldn't really eat it. Here's some [proof](http://i.imgur.com/TeGji0E.jpg).

A small pan pizza from Domino's sounds amazing right now, but I won't be picky! I'll even pick up at the store to save on the delivery fee.

Thanks in advance!
