Hey guys, I'm curled up in my dorm studying for finals. It's also freezing cold because my roommate can't fall asleep unless it's freezing. He finished his exams though and gets to sleep in, I'm sure he has a massive hangover. 

As any college student, money is tight, and it's hard to actually have a heart warming meal. I usually just rely on hot dogs without buns and ramen. 

Of course there are people that are more than me, and please, help them first. I'm not going to die, nor do I have 5 kids, just a college student. Thank you for taking the time to read this and enjoy your weekend!
