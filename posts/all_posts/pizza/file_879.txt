This past week at work, I fell off an office chair that was missing a bolt and ended up having to get a tetanus shot and 6 x-rays. I'm living from paycheck to paycheck, so I'm eating meagerly as it is, and the lost wages from the work I had to miss mean even less food from this next one, though still enough to get by. Also, I've been in a lot of pain, which has made it a really shitty week. A pizza would do wonders to improve it.

Note: I looked into worker's comp, which doesn't start compensating for lost wages until you've missed three days of work. I wasn't gone for three days because I just got a new second part-time job and didn't want to miss more than a day for fear of losing it.
