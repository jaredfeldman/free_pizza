Me and my fiancee recently lost our home. We were paying rent but the landlord was not paying the mortgage. As a result we had no where to go. We ended up having to stay in a motel untill we can find a new place. After the room is paid for the week and the car is gassed up so My fiancee can go to work just to pay for this room, There is close to nothing left. I have found work recently, but do not start for another 3 weeks. We basically live off of what food will fit in a mini- fridge. With morale being low right now, I think a hot pizza would lift spirits. There is nothing more soothing then some hot comfort food! 
And in the next few weeks I plan to buy someone a pizza myself. ... Pay it forward they say!
