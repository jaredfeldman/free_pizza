First off, I will admit I am new, and I made my account after discovering this subreddit.  But I have been a lurker for quite a while and have even gotten my mum addicted to this site (and the aww sub).  
Right now I have no gas, and that in itself is nothing new.  But I also have no food, or cash.  I'm not really a fan of spilling my life story.  I don't think it's fair to people, especially if they think I'm only after pity.  But I will explain some, at least that's connected to why I'm in this situation.  Otherwise, what's the point?  
My baby sister died when she was barely out of her teens.  I was still a teen myself at the time, and my mum took it very badly.  I ended up becoming her carer and after about five years of constantly hiding anything sharp or pill related and just generally taking care of her, I kind of snapped (or broke. However you want to put it).  It's now eleven years later and the depression pretty much controls my life.  
I do get enough money to pay most of my bills.  Though gas and shopping are the lowest priorities.  I have gas/electric here, so thankfully the gas doesn't heat the water for the shower.  
I'm not the type of person that can put off paying the bills in order to buy groceries.  Even though sometimes I really should.  That's just the way I was raised.  Sucky, yes, but at least I have the internet and tv to keep me from going insane.  

I don't know what kind of proof you could ask for about me.  But please feel free to ask away and I will try my best to verify anything.  Unless you want a picture of me.  That's just wrong.  And evil.  And....wrong :)
