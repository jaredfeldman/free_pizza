So the situation is we've been running low on food the last couple of weeks and any cash we've had has been put immediately into the car for gas to get me back and forth to work in KC.  We have been cooking rice and canned things, but have not much left to last us the next few days.  So that my husband and daughter can eat full meals, I've been skipping breakfast and lunch this week and living on hot tea and chewing gum while at work.  

It's normally not a big deal, and I can make it through the day fine, but today I'm already super-hungry and it's not even 11 am yet.  I get paid on Friday and will be able to re-stock our pantry then, but I am definitely feeling the empty hole in my tummy today.  I am thinking of going to Jimmy John's and begging for a day-old loaf of bread if they have any.

If anybody could find it in their heart to buy me a pizza today, I would be very happy, and it could last me the next few days of lunch at work until I get my check Friday afternoon.  I will even pay you back via paypal that evening after my check is deposited.
