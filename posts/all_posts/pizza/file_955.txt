So Let me just start off with an introduction. I live in a house With 13 people. We all Pay for everything together. Including food, It's basically part of our rent. We also have 4 other houses that are run this way and we all work together. Well we went to place our monthly bulk food order this week. we go through this guy who used to lie here because he does it for a few places and get a discount this way. well anyway this week we get a notification that our bulk order didn't go through because the company didn't get our money. So we call this guy and he SWEARS he paid them and its a company error. So of course we called back the company and they did a thourough search and found nothing. Now the man is not answering us or anyone. So We have no food money for this month and no food. It's my turn to cook dinner tonight and i dont know what to do. Can anyone help us out? Thanks in advance
