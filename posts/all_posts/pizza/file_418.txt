My roommates and I are pretty strapped for cash, we are all completely broke and behind on some of our bills. I haven't had money for food in a while, subsisting off of whatever I can steal from my campus eatery (hey, I'm paying for it anyways, right?) so I figured I would ask reddit for assistance on the off chance that someone could help. I would love to surprise my roommates with some hot pizza goodness.
