Hi everyone! I'm a physics grad student with a 6 year old daughter who want some pizza. We live in Albany, CA (next to Berkeley). We don't have any money because my soon-to-be ex-wife (daughter's mother) is sick (multiple sclerosis) and can't work. Bank of America stopped paying her disability pay back in January and my research stipend isn't even enough to cover our rent. So my choices are top ramen, peanut butter and jelly *again*, or a random act of pizza. 

Her mom is busy being fed at restaurants by her new boyfriend while we're here in the apartment struggling to get by. So some pizza would really hit the spot right about now.

Your kindness will be greatly appreciated.
