Just found out I have about $20 to last me 2 weeks. There is a delay in processing my student loans, so I'm left a little high and dry until that happens. My family has no money (literally unable to give me even a $100) and they're in a different state, so I can't ask them for anything. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, but I've been a redditor for a long time and just stumbled across this amazing subreddit.

This is something I will payback multiple times when I finally get back on my feet. It sucks to be in this position, so I can't wait until I can help someone out, too!
