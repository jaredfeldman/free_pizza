Hello RAOP,

figured I'd give posting here a shot. I've been out of work for about six months now, applied literally everywhere in walking and bus distance. I still live at home, and on top of stretched funds, my mother's card recently got overcharged and left us with $15 for two weeks. She gets paid in a few days but I think instead of coming home and going straight to bed, a pizza might really lift both of our spirits.
