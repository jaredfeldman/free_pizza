I am a student and I work at my school's IT call center. Pay day was supposed to be today - but everyone's time sheet was not submitted due to a clerical error. I only have .88 cents in my checking account and was really counting on getting paid today so I could go buy groceries. I have some staples in my pantry, but those really need to last for two weeks until next payday. I would really appreciate a pizza to make up for not getting paid today.
