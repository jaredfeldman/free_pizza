I have been dreaming of pizza all day. Unfortunately my sister needed some cash today, which I lent to her, forgetting don't have work tonight and can't go in to earn tips to get through the day. I am not clever or particularly talented and cannot offer anything original in exchange for pizza.

What I CAN offer is a beautiful pair of shoes, your choice! I'm a member of justfab.com, it's an online shopping site, and I have a bunch of reward points wracked up. If you'd like, you can visit their website, pick out a pair that catches your eye, and I'll have it shipped to you! In exchange for pizza!

Sweet deal!
