Hello.

I've been subsisting on tip money for the past couple of days, but I had to quit my job this morning because my manager threatened to fire me if I did not take an 18 hour shift (right after 4 hours of sleep from a 12 hour shift!). I had been working as a cook for a sports bar type place for a week and a half, but I have yet to receive my first paycheck. I quit because I cannot work for a place that does not respect the schedule, forcing me to work unannounced overtime that is often more than the scheduled time itself. I've already filled out applications to 5 places, so I am sure I'll be fine. I'll get my paycheck in the mail on Friday or Saturday, too.

About me: 19, EMS student &amp; highschool grad who no longer has tip money to carry him day to day. I moved back in with my mom from my grandparents house. My grandparents are well-off, but my mother is unemployed and gets food bill from the grandparents. She is visiting my aunt and uncle in Canada this week, so no food bill for me until Sunday. :(

What I can give in return: If I give you my Papa John's credentials, you can order just a $10 pizza to my door and I will have earned 1 free large pizza from their loyalty program. :D
I can either eat it myself or send it back to you! 2 for the price of 1!
I can also chat with you about science, academics, or just politics or really whatever you'd like to talk about. We can connect on Tumblr or Facebook if you like :3
