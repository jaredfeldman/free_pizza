It's been a tough day. I ate the last of my oatmeal this morning and haven't eaten since. Most of my last paycheck went to rent and utilities, and I don't get paid until Friday. I'm in for a rough couple of days. If someone out there can help, I'll be more than happy to comp someone else in need a pizza when I get paid.
