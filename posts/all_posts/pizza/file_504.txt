Getting over a cold would love some comfort food for dinner (pizza?) I've been living on soup for a few days and a change would be nice. I don't have any money coming in this week and I am trying to extend my measly soup and pasta diet till the end.

Thanks guys, this is completely appreciated! Can return the favor when paid.
