  Just looking to add a little food to the fridge in the form of leftovers.  I deleted a request because I requested a few times over a few days, unsuccessfully.  I should have planned for this, but I didnt and now I dont know where to turn for help.  I am in the process of finding assistance from an agency of some sort. I have never been in this position before, I am trying to adjust as best I can.
