Simply put, I'm a broke college kid who hasn't eaten since lunch yesterday...and when I say broke I am not exaggerating. I was paid today and had to use the entire check to pay my bills. I'd kill for a pizza, especially since someone walked by me with a fresh one earlier and the aroma has stained my nose. 

Details: I'm not a freeloader--I currently work on campus and am in the process of finding another job. It's surprisingly more difficult than expected, as I don't have a car or the money for a bus pass, so I have to stay in walking distance. I just got home from a 12 hour day on campus so this pizza would be the best way to end the day. 

Please be my pizza hero!
