Hi, I've never requested this before and I feel a bit ashamed in having to do so, but it would make the world of a difference. I have a good, stable job and always have. I've always been responsible with money and have nearly no debt, except for one credit card which I'm about halfway done paying. This last week has wrecked me financially. My car is a piece of shit and I spent $766 on brake stuff (pads, rotors - I can show proof of this) and now I'm nearly broke. 

I have about $70 in my account (I can also show proof of this) and I need it to fill my gas tank (which costs about $40 here in Vermont). My dad called me this morning to tell me that my grandmother was rushed to the hospital last night and she has pancreatic cancer. There's nothing they can do. They can't operate. My dad is not doing well. I'm here in Vermont and my family is in Montreal. I'd like to go to Montreal tomorrow to see my grandmother and be with everyone during this time. 

My fridge has hardly anything in it (I can show you this too!) and basically, a pizza would be a life saver tonight. It's been a rough Monday so far. A pizza would mean that I'd have a meal for dinner tonight, lunch tomorrow, and dinner on the way to Montreal tomorrow. I can also provide a verification code. I only get paid again on Thursday and so I'm looking to see if anyone will help a girl out. Many thanks.
