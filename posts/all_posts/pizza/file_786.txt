Asking in advance, I'm moving out next wednesday and it would be awesome if the first meal me and my other half get to eat together in the unit was a delicious pizza. We won't be able to afford much good food for a while because we've had to buy a lot of furniture and stuff and we're gonna be a bit short on cash. If anyone was willing to do this that would be amazing.
