I feel a little weird asking this as I don't really NEED a pizza but it's been a tough few months and the idea of cooking anything is just more than I can handle at the moment. I recently switched jobs and haven't had a day off since the end of September, had my boss basically tell me to fuck off regarding my scheduling and had a panic attack in the middle of my shift in front of customers. I'd love a pizza but simply cannot afford to order one. Anyone in the Portland, OR area want to help me out? I'll eat everything except for olives and pineapple.
