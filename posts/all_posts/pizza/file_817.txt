Hello all, I am broke and out of food and decided to try this out. I'm a 24 year old male living in Phoenix. I moved out here in October 2010 to move into a halfway house. I am an addict in recovery, been sober 11 months. In the beginning of December I moved out into my own apartment. One of the complex managers lived in the halfway house with me and was able to get me an apartment and a job painting the complex. So I have been painting to pay for the place. I am trying to food stamps, but my passport (which is required for the process) appears to have been lost in the mail, quite unfortunately. I have been receiving a lot of help from people, but at this time I do not have any food so I figured I would try this out. Thanks for reading.
