Hello, I'm TMHS, a "professional writer." This means I'm constantly broke. I have exactly $2.37 to my name until I hopefully get paid at the end of this week. My pathetic funds aren't even enough to buy my usual staple of poverty pasta from the corner store. I've been living on one meal a day for about a week, and have officially run out of food in my apartment. Its really either this or a condiment medley for dinner, so if you could find it in your heart to help me out, I would really appreciate it. 

In return I will write you a personalized short story about any topic of your choosing. It can be funny, sad, sexy, anything you want... maybe a combination of all three? Hmmm?

Thanks in advance Reddit!
