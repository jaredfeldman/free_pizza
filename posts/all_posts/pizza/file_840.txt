She has been running around all day panicking about school and work. She went up to campus twice to figure out financial aid stuff that the school mixed up, her hours just got cut back...AGAIN. We are looking to move out together soon, and with all of this going on I don't know how we're going to make that work and she's absolutely freaking out...and she gets grumpy when she's hungry. I just wish I could do something nice like get her a pizza but I don't have the money right now. Can anyone help?

P.S. I get a check on the 15th so I can pay you back or send you a pizza then!!
