I've been lactose intolerant my entire life, and I just recently was given "Lactaid" pills (by recently, I just got back from the doctor's office) so that I can enjoy cheesy goodness (something I haven't done in 4 years.) Unfortunately, I'm a broke college student blah blah, you know the story. I'd really appreciate a pizza so I can thoroughly enjoy it :)

I live in the GTA area in Ontario, Canada.
When I have some money to spare, I'm willing to pay it forward.
And reddit, you can hold me to that :)
