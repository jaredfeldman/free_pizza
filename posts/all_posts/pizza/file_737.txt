I will receive my second paycheck at my new job (recent graduate) on the 10th! It's so close! But my last paycheck was on June 25 and all of that went to rent so we had to make $40 from my future husband's paycheck last us for groceries. I went shopping on June 29, but we have run out of all the food I bought. We would really love a pizza to hold us over today until my paycheck comes in.
