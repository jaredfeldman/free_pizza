I live in Galveston, Texas and go to Texas A&amp;M University. Last week my tuition was due and so my school took my money from my checking account, which left me with an overdrawn account and maxed out credit card, which is linked to my checking account. 

I really am in a bind. I signed up for a short term loan and don't get paid until Friday. I do have some food left, but it's all canned stuff that I am trying to save for the next two weeks. I still have the electricity and phone bills to pay next week so I don't know when I will be able to buy food again.
Here's my original comment and PIC in another [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/il3kf/offer_i_have_some_extra_cash_and_id_like_to_buy/c24nm4c)
