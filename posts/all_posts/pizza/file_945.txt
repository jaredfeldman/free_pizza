Been a cancer(glioblastoma) survivor for 3 years now and been trying to find myself a permanent stable job, been surviving but this month has been rough. High bills this month and a car accident have cost me a lot of money, plus the gas use from having like 4 appts with the doctor and oncology(both about 30 min away) have drained my acct to about 2 dollars. It'd be awesome to dig into a pizza tonight instead of try and find something resembling a meal in my fridge or resorting to eating a roommate's food since he's not in the best of situations either.


Halp?
