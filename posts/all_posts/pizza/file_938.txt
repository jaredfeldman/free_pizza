[Edit:  Fountain, Colorado]

My wife and I live on my social security, and anyone out there on it knows the dates for benefits always suck because it never pays on the same date, always making things bad.  Our families are several states away and they're broke too.  My grandmother sent us cookies a few days ago and that's what we've lived on other than some instant rice.  We even started googling whether we can eat the cat's food.  We usually only eat one meal a day and a pizza would get us so much closer.  

I have been pizza'd before in a contest and we gave that away months ago to someone who needed it a lot more than us.   Thank you RAOP.
