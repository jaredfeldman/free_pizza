Alright guys, I don't have some major sob story, my life isn't that bad or anything, I'm just broke until next Thursday when my University issues refund checks to students. My promise to you all, is that if I can get a pizza tonight, I will pay it forward to a lucky individual next week, when I get my loan money from school. Otherwise, I'm making ramen tonight (again). Here is a picture of me with my scooting goggles on, so you know how serious this is. We roll hard down in the southwest.
