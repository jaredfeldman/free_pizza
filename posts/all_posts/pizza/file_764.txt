My poor cat [Pandora](http://imgur.com/onbwp) fell ill a few days ago, so I took her to the vet. She's on Endro Floxacin (22.7 g) for the next week. It took the last of my cash ($100) to get her some help, and I still owe some but it's not due until February. I'm currently in school but will be working soon. My mom is sending me some cash in the mail but it won't get here for a few days. Any help would be nice :)
