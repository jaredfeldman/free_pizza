  I've currently had a series of shitty things happen to me over the course of two weeks, and it's not been looking good atm.  This month has been pretty tough without finaid. I had to come up with rent from frantically borrowing from friends or get evicted from my apartment.  Leaving me with a negative balance in my account as of now and I would really love a hot meal.
