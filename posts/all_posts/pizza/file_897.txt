This is my first and only time doing this, but I have a good friend a couple of states away in TN whos life isn't going to well right now. She is responsible for saving me from myself a few years ago and is a great person. Her life isn't going so well right now and she needs a good cheering up. I really don't want to come off as begging, but I don't have the money to do this right now. Dominos is the only place in the area that delivers to her house. She LOVES pizza. If anyone can help with this, well that'd be really great.
