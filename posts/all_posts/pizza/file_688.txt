Hey RAP, I just recently moved from my hometown near Seattle (had to get away from some toxic people) and am having a real tough time of it.  I don't like asking for handouts but I don't know how I can eat anymore ramen noodles.  Any help for someone who had to take out a payday loan just to make rent this month would be amazingly appreciated.  Thanks.
