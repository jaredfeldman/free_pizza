Currently been living on about 30 dollars for the last week and a half in college, waiting to get my student loan. There's been a strike going on though so I couldn't try to schedule a pickup until this week, and today I learned they still think I'm on my probation from last term (Which I corrected by achieving a high enough GPA and got off probation with the school, but not OSAP). 

Anyway, it's going to be a while before I can even pick up that loan but even after all that it will take a little bit before it's deposited to me. A pizza would easily last me a few nights worth of dinner and certainly beat the rice krispies and peanut butter sandwiches I've had for every meal the last week.

Once that loan comes through I'll be sure to pizza it forward if someone comes through for me :)

I'm located in Oakville, Ontario
