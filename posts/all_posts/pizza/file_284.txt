Thought I'd ask for a pizza to make me feel better. I've been closing up at work for going on two weeks now, getting paid minimum wage and putting almost every cent toward rent next month. Coming home to a bowl of ramen and sleeping until time to do it all again is starting to wear on me. Anyone out there the kind of person who wants to give a random internet stranger[me] a pizza for troubles that, I'm sure, sound less troubling on a screen?
