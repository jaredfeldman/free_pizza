~~So here is the deal, Im stuck at work on a 12hr shift over night in a completely empty 12 story high rise. I dont have enough cash to order pizza ($6) and nothing close enough that i can afford(even if i did sneak away i.e. McD/Jacnk in the box/taco bell). Can pay it forward in the future~~

No longer needed thanks /u/Full-Flavor
