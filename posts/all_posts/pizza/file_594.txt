I am really hungry, not too broke but i need the rest of my money which is only 23$ to last me until Monday (i get paid) , and i still need to buy gas for work, my fridge is empty. No sob story im just honestly really hungry and would like it if someone could donate me a pizza and i would love to repay the favor to the giver or someone else on the site, idk maybe we can work somethings out. Thank you.
