Life is rough as is but especially when your job shorts your check 8 hours.  I get paid again Wednesday though and that check will have the hours I was missing from last pay day added on.

I'm in Dallas, the Cowboys scored over 20 points last night and Papa John's has a promo for 50% off.  With half off, I figure I can be fed until Wednesday.  Help?

I will definitely pay it forward.

:EDIT:

Request fulfilled.
