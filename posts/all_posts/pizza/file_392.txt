Can you help make it a date night?

Here's the sitch (is that how you abbreviate it? I know how it's said, but I don't think I've seen it in writing....)

My girlfriend has been working hard to support us since I lost my job. Long hours, crappy boss, you know the drill. 

About an hour ago I just got a short gig, so I can start to contribute again, but it will still be a while before we're back on our feet completely.

As I feel it is my boyfriendly duty, the least I can do for everything she does, I give her a lot of massages. Back, neck, arms, feet, I do it all baby! I'm rubbing those knots out like nobody's business.

But now my hands remind me of my grandpa's (except the skin doesn't look paper thin). Knuckles the size of cherries, stiff as a board. Ok so that's quite an exaggeration, they don't really hurt. But still.

I would love to be able to have a pizza tonight with her, as a sort of thank you type date thing, since we don't always get to eat together and it's never something you find on /r/FoodPorn
