Hello pizza friends,

I'm a UK postgraduate student who's been putting in long hours into her PhD and is getting a mighty craving for a pizza. Unfortunately, I only get paid every four months, and I'm at the end of a pay period so money is very tight.

As my payday is Monday, I intend to pay it forward and send some hungry redditor a pie once the money hits my account.

Additionally, if you feed me, I'll send you a picture of my very cute pet rabbit, being cute. Deal?

Thank you very much!
