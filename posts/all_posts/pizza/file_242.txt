My dad passed away a couple of months ago. Since I'm in full-time school, I wasn't able to go back to work, I knew that the stress of dealing with dad being gone and school AND work would be too much. He was my best-friend, and the only one who helped me when I needed it. 
 My boyfriend has a job, which he was supposed to start 3 weeks ago, but due to the weather he's not starting until this weekend. We are completely strapped for cash, and our cupboards are bare.
 If anyone is willing to help us out, we can pay it forward with his first cheque. 
I hate asking for help, but I figure, what the hell, it's just some pizza and I'd love to pay it forward.
