Dear RAoP, I am a freelance graphic/web designer working out of my apartment in fabulous Dallas, TX. I also happen to be about 9 weeks 5 days pregnant with my first child. I am extremely hungry, and nothing in my kitchen is doing it for my cravings. (Any pregnant/former pregnant women know what I am talking about!) I have tried to reason with Oran/Orenda and let s/he know that Mama hasn't gotten paid yet, and cannot obtain the pineapple and tomato sauce that seems amazing. However, reasoning does nothing for hormones and fetuses, so I turn to you guys at Random Acts of Pizza. Can someone help, and I will gladly pay it forward/back come Friday!

Proof of an ultrasound can be provided upon request
