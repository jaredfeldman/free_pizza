Hey RAoP, I feel bad even asking for this, but I've ran into a bit of a pinch. I recently lost my job, and my mother and brother-in-law had to come to stay with us until after the holidays due to losing their heat. Unfortunately we don't have the means to feed everyone. After going to get them because they have no car, we had to use what little money we had for gas. Thanks in advance!
