Title says it all. The two guys that were scheduled to work with me today both didn't show, so I'm stuck talking to customer and fixing computers alone all day long :(

Normally the owner would buy me lunch in these situations, but he just had a hip replacement, and I'm stuck running the show till he gets back. 

It's no biggie, but I can't leave to grab lunch. There's a Papa Johns around the corner that we usually order from for company outings. 

If anyone's willing.. I guess shoot me a PM and we'll work out the details?? I've never done this before...
