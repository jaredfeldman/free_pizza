title says it all. was 2 weeks late on rent so i had to pay my landlord off Monday when he came back into town. he worked with me on the payment thank god. i get paid every two weeks, my next check comes on friday afternoon (the 25th) i would absolutely pay it back or pay it forward, your choice. pizza would last me until saturday evening since i work during the days. it would help so much, and truly be appreciated. i have never received a pizza here before
