First world problems here, nothing major.

Short story, I am working on two competing projects within one company (doesn't make sense to me either) and I have tight deadlines on both.  So that means I get to work this weekend in order to even come close to meeting the deadline.  Who wants to cheer me up?  If nobody, that's cool too.
