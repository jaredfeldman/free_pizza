I'm intimidated to ask for food like this, but my husband works five days a week to support the two of us and our puppy. He always does a great job managing bills, including our puppy, gas, etc. We try to buy enough groceries to last us the two weeks before pay-day and in between he gives plasma for extra cash.

This week he received a vacation for all of the days he's gone in early or when it was his day off and we've been waiting for Thursday (he gives plasma Thurs/Sat) for a night to finally have money for some good food.

On his way home from the Biolife center a few minutes ago he called me and said he was stuck at a gas station because he tried using the Biolife card to get gas. The pump automatically charges a card $75 dollars, I believe, and then puts back whatever you didn't use. My husband pulled the pump out to use it, realized the car was too far back, and put the pump back to pull the car forward. Somehow by doing that something got cancelled and the money is being withheld. When he called the card company they said it could be up to 7 days before it goes back into the account. My husband had to call his boss and ask if he could use the business card for $3 in gas to get home that he'd pay back Monday.

It would be so amazing if someone would provide us that awesome Thursday night we had planned. The favor *will* be returned by Saturday when he gives plasma again! We've never done this so if you're willing to walk us through how to go about receiving and then giving back when able it would be greatly appreciated!
