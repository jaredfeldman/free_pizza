Hello, we've posted before when we first got to Cali back in August, but never got a response so we thought we'd give it another shot. There are 4 of us here, 2 kids and 2 adults, just looking to see if there are any kind people out there willing to help us out with Dinner tonight. Haven't had the best of luck since we got to Cali. Yesterday was Halloween, but kids didn't get to do anything other than go hang out at church cause we couldn't afford to do costumes this year. 

If there are any kind heart'd people on tonight willing to help us out this one time it would be great. I'll be able to donate $10 to someone on the 18th, i realize it's not much, but I've seen others like myself on here seeking help so i'm going to try my best to do help them out whether someone helps me or not. But once again we're asking if there are any kind heart'd ppl out there willing to help us this time we'd really appreciate it. 

Thank You &amp; God Bless
