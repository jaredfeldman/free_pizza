i got in a car accident yesterday and had to spend the last of my money just trying to get home. i don't get paid until wednesday, and i tried to get a cash advance from work, but my boss denied me. i have absolutely no food left in my house, and when i called both my parents to ask for help, my mom just laughed and said to "figure it out yourself" and my dad had nothing to send me (he lives in oregon.) i feel bad asking for something like this, but...i'm out of options. i haven't eaten since last night and i just don't know what to do anymore...
