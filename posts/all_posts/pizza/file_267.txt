Not like dying sick, just don't-feel-like-moving sick. Soup &amp; noodles just isn't cutting it, but pizza isn't exactly in my budget right now.

I'd love to just have something tasty to eat on for a few days while I recover.

I live in Pinebluff, NC &amp; the only place that delivers is Pizza Hut, so an eGift for there would be amazing. Thanks!
