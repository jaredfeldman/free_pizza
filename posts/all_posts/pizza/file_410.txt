The government screwed up and now we have to wait over a month for them to refile and reestablish my claim.  There is no way to expedite this at all, in spite of the fact that it is their mistake.  We have 2 girls (9 and 7) and 3 boys (5,3, 2months).

My wife had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital last week for emergency gall bladder removal surgery and we are feeling a bit beat on at the moment.  This would be a humungous pick-us-up.

I am happy to provide any verification you need.  Thanks in advance.
