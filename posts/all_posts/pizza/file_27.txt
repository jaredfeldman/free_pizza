Honestly, I dont know what to put here. Im not preggos, I have no shitty roommate. I live with my girlfriend and my 2 cats. Ive been unemployed for 3 years and Im not on any kind of "benefits". Usually, I dont like asking for help like this, but unfortunately I have nothing for us to eat tonight except for a quarter box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. While normally, this would be totally awesome, we have done nothing but eat CTC for the last 2 days. Im at the point where Im down to trade for a pizza or two. I attend Comic-Con every year and I do have some spare memorabilia Ive gotten in years past. I would totally be willing to trade somebody some comic-con swag for some food. Thanks for reading.  Oh, i live in Orange County California, fyi. Thanks Again.

:edit:Awesome! Got a pizza tonight from "truongbv" Saved the day!
