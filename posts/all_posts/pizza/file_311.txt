Hey guys so I just heard about this subreddit, it's crazy how great of a community this is. So I've been watching over my younger sister and 2 brothers (10, 8 &amp; 7 respectively). For the past 6 weeks now, we've been staying at my mother's house while she's away. I love em Im a lot older so i took care of all three since they were babies I'm almost like an uncle haha. I've been paying all the bills except the rent. I work part time as a janitor while they're at school but have to be at the bus stop when they get off every day. On food stamps so we get by but we're running low and they honestly don't get a treat like this often. So yeah I don't want to post a whole story of my life but if there's anyone out there who's willing it would be truly appreciated! Im not asking for much, just a large pizza or maybe 2 mediums? Any questions, just ask! Thanks.
