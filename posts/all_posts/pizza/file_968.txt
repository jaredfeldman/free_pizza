I've ended up sticking myself in a bit of a rut, guys. I've been living on my own for about 6 months now, and about 3 months ago, finally found a job. It's great and all, but the hours are less than desirable. Corporate won't let us go over 32 hours a week. I get paid every two weeks. This last pay period has hit me pretty hard in the wallet department. I finally had the money saved up to put down on a vehicle. A motorcycle, actually. Considering how cheap they are overall, I think it was a pretty good choice. Unfortunately, paying my bills, $100 out of the paycheck for the motorcycle payment, and another $100 or so to get it road legal...Has left me without food until Friday. The change that I've collected over the past couple months adds up to $6.17, which I need to use to fill my gas tank so I can get to work.  I'll be straight up here, a large pizza could feed me for 2 days, 3 if I stretch it. I would certainly be willing to pay it forward to another unfortunate soul in the coming weeks, if someone were to help me out now.
