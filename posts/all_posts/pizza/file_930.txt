Hey reddit, ive just been diagnosed as HIV positive thanks to my prostitute of a GF, and i mean actual prostitute. I was stupid enough to stay with her once i found out, she gave me a list of promises which i bought into and im paying the price. I have had to drop out of my medicine degree at uni thanks to the diagnosis and my friends are already treating me differently like an invalid - my best friends are all out tonight and havent invited me and think i dont know. I have no career, a huge student debt and a bottle of vodka to keep me company tonight. Would really appreciate a nice pizza before i have to face what happend with my life. If anyone can help please do.

thanks reddit and sorry about my whinging
