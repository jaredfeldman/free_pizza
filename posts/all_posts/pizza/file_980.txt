Hey guys, I've been living off of protein shakes and cereal these past few days because I can't really afford to buy anything yet, and I've just about run out of anything. The few leftover dollars I did have went towards food for my gerbils. If anyone could help me out with some food for tonight that would be great. I just have to wait one more day and I'll have some income coming in, I'll be able to help anyone in need tomorrow :]
