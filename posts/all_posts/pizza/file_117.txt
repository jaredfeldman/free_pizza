Hey everyone,

So, I was a student at Central Michigan University last semester, but due to financial reasons, I couldn't attend this semester.  I used the last of my money recently to sign onto a friends lease, so my bank accounts are currently zero-ed out, and I don't have a credit card.

  I had gotten hired by a pyramid scheme place, and they didn't pay me, even though I met the criteria to get paid.  I just had orientation for a new job, but I won't start for another week, and won't get paid for another two.  I have almost no food in this house, except for some bread, and some crackers.  Is there any way someone could send me some pizza? It'd be greatly appreciated, and I would pay it forward once I have some cash. 

Thanks for reading.
