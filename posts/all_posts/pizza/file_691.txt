So today I got fired, which blows. My car got hit last night in the parking lot and the whole front in is destroyed. I called into work and said if I didn't make it in I would be fired. I couldn't find a ride from anyone, so I got fired. Definitely a total bummer day. If anyone can help me out, I would appreciate it a ton.
