Due to my own financial stupidity, and some bad timing, the entire paycheck that I receive tonight will go towards rent/late fees/utilites (specifically, water and trash.)

If anyone decides that I am in any way worthy of a pie, I will ration it off for as long as I need to (I have a few canned vegetables that will do as well.)

I will gladly pay anything back/forward, and do simple requests.

I live in Raleigh, North Carolina.

I appreciate anything in advance, even if just looking.

Gracias, amigos/as!
