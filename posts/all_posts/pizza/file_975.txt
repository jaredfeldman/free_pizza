Hey guys,
I've been broke as a joke the last couple weeks. Raided the pantry completely and have made plenty of "canned food and rice" surprises. Last of the monies went in the gas tank and I'm now down to the last cup of applesauce and could use a solid meal and leftovers for the next couple days. I have payment coming this Tuesday/Wednesday and will gladly return the favor to my offerer! 
Thanks!
