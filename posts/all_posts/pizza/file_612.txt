I went over my current fiances, and I 'think' I can make next months rent. But involved in that process has been cutting down what I eat, and especially how much. I've been basically living on beans, rice, pickles, and potatoes. Now don't get me wrong, I'm glad to have anything. But I'm a little worried about what the lack of variation is going to do to my health. And I'll admit it, even more I just miss tasting a thing that has a flavor. 

I've been posting on reddit for over three years now, for what that's worth. I think more important is the fact that one of the reasons I don't have money now is that I wound up donating a lot of it to the homeless when I did...and then I lost my job. 

I do work now, but my total income is far below minimum wage. And I'm just scraping by. A pizza would mean more than most people would guess to me. I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/iite6/thanks_what_pizza_can_mean/) about a week back, about what someone's gift of a pizza to me a while back, before this subreddit existed, meant. That's where the meat of my sob story is. 

tl;dr: Lack of food makes me rambly and I beg for pizza.
