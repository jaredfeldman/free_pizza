My husband and I recently got married and moved into a new place, spent money on rent, furniture, groceries. I just recently found a job but I don't start until next weekend. My husband is in the military but don't let that fool you, they give us just enough to pay our bills and we've been eating rice for days. I would appreciate any redditor willing to help us out so we can enjoy our saturday night together once he comes home from work. I will definitely pay it forward as soon as I start work next weekend!
