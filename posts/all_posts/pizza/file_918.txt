So, I've been having a really terrible week. On Saturday my cat of 12 years passed away(had him since I was 10, really the best cat i've ever met). On Monday I found out that my hours are getting docked, meaning I have to start saving this very moment or I won't be able to afford both food and rent in a month or so. 

Here's a picture of Ping- my cat, from a few months ago:
