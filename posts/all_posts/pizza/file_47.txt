I'm currently moving and all my food/cookware is packed and gone already. The security deposit I was told and counting on getting back today is not coming, landlord claims damages from a storm we had last year. *sigh* So I have no money for anything except the gas to drive me to my new place tomorrow night. I feel so selfish posting here when maybe there are others it would better benefit, but a pizza would certainly be welcome here today. Thanks reddit.
