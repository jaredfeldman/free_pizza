My wife and I are avid pizza fans, but this month has been exceptionally tight fiscally. Having recently put together a new monthly budget (with more reasonable expenses) we've acted more responsibly, but had considerably less fun.  
If anyone would be so kind as to reward our new financial responsibility with dietary irresponsibility, that would be grand. I'm sure the kids would love something more than just bland-yet-wholesome Spaghetti for the third night in a row.  
Thanks for taking the time to read, and have a great day no matter what.
