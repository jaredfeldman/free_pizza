Hey there.

I've been struggling the past few months but this week has been a little rougher than most.  A check I was expecting from a temp job I had worked was lost in the mail and it sounds like I won't receive the reissued one until later this week or early next week.  My bank account is looking real sad right now and I've used up the last bit of my spare change to cover transit fare.  I've been eating a lot of rice and ramen but some pizza would be really nice if anyone could help.

Thanks for reading :)
