My husband and I are buying our first new car today.  We are not in dire straights by any means, but buying a new car is definitely putting a huge dent in our wallets.  I would like to surprise my husband tonight with a celebratory pizza that didn't put any extra strain on our bank account.  The car payments over the next 5 years will being doing enough of that.  Thank you!
