2 more days until payday and my man and I are starving! Anyone care to help us out? We'll gladly return the favor on Thursday when he gets paid! We've been reading through these stories and you folks are the best, glad to see that someone out there still has a heart for people far worse off than us!

edit: Forgot our location, we're in Austin texas!!
