I was invited to Reddit after playing checkers on Yahoo. I told the person that I was playing that I was craving a pizza, but didn't have any money to buy one. They suggested that I try my luck here. I've been eating rice and beans for about a week and while I shouldn't complain, it is getting old. A nice Hawaiian pizza would be more than enough for the wife and I. Something different to lift our spirits. Happy New Years from North Carolina!
