So I've been functionally poor for ages now and I didn't realise how long ago it's been since I had pizza until today where I've been hit with an immense craving. I'm not here to boo hoo about how it sucks to have no cash - so many people here have it so much worse than me and I'm lucky just to be able to keep my shit together to the point where I've got a roof over my head.

Anyway - I'm sick to death of supermarket own brand tins of crap and bread that's a day out of date (But 15-20p so bargain, right?). Allow me to have some pizza and allay my fate.

Also seeing as Pizza Hut keep posting vouchers through my door I figured I'd better ask before I forcible return them to sender with a vengeance.

EDIT: I have nothing else to do with my time so I'm just going to chill and wait here :)

EDIT 2: Appreciating the support everyone!
