Howdy, I seem to be in a predicament. I have bronchitis,  and I can't get out of bed. I spent all my money getting antibiotics and an inhaler. All I really need is a pizza. I think I just coughed up a good piece of my lung. Oh well. But really, I'll love you forever. I believe in paying it forward, so I think I'm done rambling.
