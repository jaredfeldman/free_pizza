We've been pretty responsible people, my Girlfriend and I.  We've worked hard, spent within our means, and have always been on time with all of our bills and rent.  It seems that last part may have gotten us in a bit of deep water.  After doing the right thing and scraping by, it has come.  My Girlfriend's student loans have kicked in.  This has been a bit of a culture shock to us, and in all honesty, we weren't prepared.  

Our total amount of bills almost doubled because of this new one.  My girlfriend has been a bit stressed of late, as have I, because it's increasingly looking like one of us(if not both) is going to have to take on a second job, or the eviction fairy shall be making it's rounds.  We have enough food for maybe one meal, and the nearest payday is next week.  It would be a great stress reliever, and an overall solid evening if me and my girlfriend could share a Pizza tonight.  

It would be double the awesome, because her absolute favorite food is pizza, and seems skeptical of this entire community(Reddit all together, not just RAOP). If one of you fine Redditors could show us the way to pizza goodness, not only will you have the good karma, and satisfaction of helping a hard working college grad out, I'll also get my girlfriend to draw you a rad picture!  Win, Win in my book.  

I'm located in NW Ohio, and at the moment we only have a Pizza Hut within the miles we have gas to make it too. Thank you in advance, and know, that I am in love with the RAOP community.  This is a true beacon of humanity.  Kudos!
