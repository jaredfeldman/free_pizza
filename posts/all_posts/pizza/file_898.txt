Hey guys,

I've heard good things about this subreddit, hopefully someone could help out with a pizza just until friday?  Recently moved and my first check was almost entirely spent getting the deposit covered for power and the last half of my move in cost.  I saw "almost" because I only have about $0.75 left until Friday.

Would someone want to help a guy out with a pizza until the end of the week?  I will gladly pay this forward the very second I'm paid again.  Thanks so much reddit!

edit: I do have a verification number.
