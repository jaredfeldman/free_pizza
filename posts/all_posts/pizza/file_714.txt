Hey Guys,

I'm not one to ask for charity. I'm just in a little bit of a pinch. I just recently started a new career and as such I've now been about 3 weeks without a paycheck. With paying my rent and all my bills, I'm now down to about $8 to live off of until my first paycheck comes on friday. As soon as I'm in a better way, I want to pay it forward. So if anyone could be of help, would be incredibly grateful. Thank you!)
