I knew this subreddit existed, but hadn't thought about it lately. I was about to preheat the oven to cook my usual dinner..a dollar tree 1$ "Celeste" brand mini pizza and a dollar tree burrito. Thats totally fine, cant complain life is good...but I realized hell its my bday, Im an electrical engineering senior that busts his ass constantly and lives off nothing, no job, just fafsa  (thats long out by now), maybe someone will think I deserve a pizza. 


Proof of everything I have said above (plus you could just fb me to verify with all the info available from picture): removed
