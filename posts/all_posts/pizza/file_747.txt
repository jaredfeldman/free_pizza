My buddy and I just went on a mission across Chicago to supposedly pick up my paycheck. Turns out they didn't have it, and now we just spent our last dollar on two slurpees from 7-11. 


Would love a pizza right now, and Papa Johns would seem like the best fit, seeing as how it's right down the street from where I'm by, but would take any of the big 3. Appreciate it. 


Will pay it forward once my paycheck actually comes through.
