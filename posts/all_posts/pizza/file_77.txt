My boyfriend's mom has been hinting at the fact that she would like to have a lap dog to keep her company.  Boyfriend and I find the perfect one and spend the last of our cash for the week to get it We. bring it over to surprise her with it and her controlling boyfriend says she can't have the dog because he didn't get her for it.  So now we have a sweet new puppy to find a home for, and no money.  Not to mention that my boyfriend is devastated by this (he doesn't know I am posting).  Pizza would help boost his crushed spirit.

TL:DR Tried to surprise boyfriend's mom with dog she wanted, got denied by her controlling boyfriend. Boyfriend devastated.
