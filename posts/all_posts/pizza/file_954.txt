So if you check my history you'll see in the last three weeks my credit card was skimmed, my car window busted, stitches put in my back without insurance, etc. etc.

Today I just got my electric bill. $320 dollars because my 17 year old thermostat decided it'd be cool to run the AC and heat at the same time. I work part time for a non-profit that doesn't pay much. With everything that's happened, I am tapped out and will be for a couple months. A pizza can probably last me three days of leftover goodness. 

I've been making the most of noodles, rice, and such from the Food Bank for the past week. I'm hungry and I hate scammers. I intend to pay it forward. I have no problems using the verification code/PMing my address/sending you a printscreen of the adorable graph on my bill quadrupling/etc.

Thank you friends.
