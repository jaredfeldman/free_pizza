I wouldn't normally be asking random people for help because I dont like asking for things but im in a tough spot right now. I was an explosive specialist from 2002-2006 (2006-2008 Inactive Reserves) I now work in security (im at work now) I dont make alot of money even with a college degree, I dont get paid until friday I have no lunch and no dinner (well I have 3 boxes of mac n cheese at home) I litterally have 3 boxes of mac n cheese 1 package of hot dogs and 3 cans of sphagetti o's to last until friday...so if anyone could help and get me something to eat and maybe take home to my wife and two kids I would greatly appreiciate it. I have proof of serive if you want it.
