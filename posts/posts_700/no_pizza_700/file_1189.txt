I'm kind of having a terrible day. Basically, last night I went out, got drunk, and drunk texted an ex-boyfriend that I had just recently become friends with. He told my best friend, who basically told me that he was uncomfortable and I need to leave him alone. Obvious pro-tip: don't keep your phone nearby if you're drunk. 

Anyway, I'm an idiot and I feel like crap and I'm a little low on cash because I have to move apartments in the middle of next month, so I have to put down rent on both places. It means a lot of nights playing Fable and eating fruit cocktail. A pizza would really help me get through the day. I've given before - and I hate asking - but I would be so, so grateful if I could get one.
