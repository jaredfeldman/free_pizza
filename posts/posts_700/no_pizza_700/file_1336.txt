He's a 20 y/o Canadian. We live in different cities each attending a different uni so we frequently skype and he's always talking about how hungry he is and how he's just dying for some decent food (and pizza happens to be his favourite food). He's pretty broke and is trying to pay off uni tuition so he's saving every penny for it. I'd buy him some but i've only got just enough for myself. If there's someone out there looking to help a broke student out, let me know!
