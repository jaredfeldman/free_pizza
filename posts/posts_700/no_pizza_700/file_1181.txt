Pretty much the title. The family in my household are much older, and also hoarders, and recently my kitchen has become very disgusting due to a fuit fly infestation. Aside from physiologically messing me up, it kind of also makes eating or preparing anything in the kitchen unbearable with a hundred little disgusting flys buzzing around. They have always been hoarders, but the past couple years the living standard has gone down pretty bad in this place..

 I plan to spend tomorrow really getting in there and doing some damage(cleaning wise), they even managed to get into and breed in the microwave. 

Needless to say, I have been eating out a lot more than usual(McDonalds dollar menu is a godsend) and it's killing my bank, which approximately now has 1 dollar and something cents, or else i'd order myself pizza.

So I  have my verification code and would be tremendously grateful for this act not to mention making sure to return the favor when I have more cash at hand(poor college student, ofcourse) to another unlucky individual. 

Thanks for your time.
