After reading some of these posts, it really warms my heart to know there are such great people out there in the world. Figured I'd throw my request out there and see what happens.

I just finished up my junior year at the University of Alabama, I'm double majoring in Marketing and Finance, so I've had to take out a whole lump of loans to pay for everything. My mom and dad help out as much as they can, but I'm the youngest of 4 and they are tapped out at this point.

I'm working as a summer intern at a local law firm, but of course they don't have to pay me anything, so I'm essentially an indentured servant to them :(

But I'll scrape by, I always have, and always will, but if anyone had it in their heart and could manage it, I would love a pizza over the weekend. I've got some girlfriends coming over, and for some reason a wine and pizza night sounds pretty great right now.
