We're a young couple in California struggling to get by.  The good news is we're both working again and my first paycheck comes next week!  However, I'd be understating the situation if I said our bank account was merely empty.  We're looking for a kind soul to provide a meal for us this evening.  In exchange, we're thrilled to use part of that first pay check to send a pizza to TWO hungry people next.  What a wonderful system, and we're hoping it'll work for us.  Please touch base with us and we'll give you whatever information you need.  Thanks so, so much, and we look forward to, well, paying it forward!
