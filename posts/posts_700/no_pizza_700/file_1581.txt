I work for a section of my university that cleans windows. They have been trying to shut us down for a while since we don't bring in money just cost it. We had a meeting with our boss and she Informed us that we will not have jobs after this week. We where told the reason why was no room in the budget. Well I don't have room in my budget to not get a pay check anymore. Thank you for helping and thank you for listening.
