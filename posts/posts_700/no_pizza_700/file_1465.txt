Me and my girlfriend of three years just moved into our first apartment together, a little one bedroom in a small college town. We're both students and employed, but the move has proven costly. 

We don't have any food in our fridge and my car broke down earlier today while I was moving stuff to our apartment. 

Any random act of pizza would not only cure our hunger but would also make my day ten times better.
