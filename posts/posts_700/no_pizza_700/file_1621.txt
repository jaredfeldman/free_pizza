Hello, my name is Nicole, and I wish I could be here under different circumstances, last month my mother was diagnosed with Leiomyosarcoma it is a form of cancer that is very strong and when diagnosed with it the outcome is usually bad. She had an abdominal hysterectomy and we were hoping that it removed all of the cancer but it has not

Mother went to the Dr. today and we were told it has spread to her lungs and her throat, she goes to a different cancer/radiation specialist on june 7th to begin radiation therapy.

So i don't think this post belongs here and I honestly do not know where to post it, mom is sleeping right now and I am glad for that but I don't know what to do anymore.


I know I am asking so much from strangers out here and you don't know me from a hill of beans but I don't know what to do, my husband is working 2 jobs to help us and my mother and I am on disability for an old hip injury.

So if anyone can help please I would be grateful, please can you perhaps help us find a smaller home for rent in the Sacramento Ca area?

We are renting a 5 bedroom home to also care for my older brother who has Multiple Sclerosis but we can't do this alone anymore and I feel so lost, I am trying to be strong for mother, just like she has been there for us all these years and it is hard.

A smaller home could be even a 3 bedroom, we can make a living room into a sleeping area if need be but I just can't do this by myself and I am afraid of our landlord when he hears we cannot afford this home, I don't know what is going to happen and I am scared.

Thank you for reading this and I am very sorry it is so long but I feel you should know about me before making your decision to help my us all.
