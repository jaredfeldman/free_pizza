I am retired army and a disabled veteran and I also have a cleaning business. Right now contracts are very low and so my income has dropped. The cost of the business has started eating into my personal funds and until contracts increase I'm living day to day. I have 1 bag of beans left on the shelf and the food pantry is closed for the weekend as a matter of fact it's closed Monday also. I work hard and that won't stop because I enjoy what I do, I'm just stuck and asking for a little help to keep my family fed and I hope to be able to help someone else in the future :)
