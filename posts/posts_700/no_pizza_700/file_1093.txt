hello fellow redditors,

I am a contract programmer, and have been waiting over a week and a half for Canada Post to deliver at least one of my recent pay cheques.

So far I've managed to get by on a bit of groceries I had in my cupboard and from the food bank... but these supplies have unfortunately run dry.

Every day, I check the mail like an eager kid waiting for that parcel he ordered from the back of a comic book... but so far, nothing.

I tend to be really generous when I do have cash and have bought many meals for hungry folks... and will certainly be putting up an [Offer] post in here when my cheques finally do arrive.

If anyone out there sympathizes with the daily sinking heart feeling of waiting for that *special and important piece of mail*... please help a brother out?

Thanks guys!

**EDIT:** I live in Victoria, BC, Canada ... Postal Code: V8T 4A6 ... there is a [Pizza Zone](http://www.pizzazone.ca/) and a [Palagio Pizza](http://www.palagio.ca/) very close by to me!
