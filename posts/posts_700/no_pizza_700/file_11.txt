I have never requested a pizza before but I've given a few out, so I'm a firm believer that this works. However, I'm spending Christmas with the in-laws, who are sceptical about the generosity of Redditors. Please prove them wrong with a pizza! Will send a thank-you of the whole fam, including cat! We are in R.O.I
