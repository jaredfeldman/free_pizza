Hi RAOP!

My two roommates and I are all full time volunteers working with AmeriCorps this year. We get payed less than minimum wage, and work full time serving people in poverty.

We're all really hungry right now, and we spent all of our money on rent and bills.

Anyone care to hook three starving, hard working people with some Papa John's?
