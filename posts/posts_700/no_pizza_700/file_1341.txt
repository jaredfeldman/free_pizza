I'm not sure how I would get a pizza. :( I live near McConnellsburg, Pa. and we have a few local places, but nobody that delivers. I could go pick it up, but I'm not sure how that would work.

It's the day before payday and I'd really like something other than bean and bacon soup for dinner.

I've given in the past and I'll give again this week if I can get some yummies tonight! :)
