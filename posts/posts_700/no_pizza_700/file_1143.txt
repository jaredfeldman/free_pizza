I'll write it about whatever you like. I'm a songwriter so you're getting a real, quality song. For the sake of time, I'll write it on an acoustic guitar and record a video. If you want better quality after that; I can record it for you.

I woke up dying for a pizza but it's one of those "broke 'til payday" weeks. It'll be much appreciated!
