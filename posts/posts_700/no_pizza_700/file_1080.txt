Been a rough few days with work and my personal life. Cell phone bill overdrew my account last night, had to borrow some money to get it back positive and be able to buy my bus tokens to get to work. Will pay it forward as soon as I'm able to.

Located in Northeast Philadelphia, can offer whatever verification needed.
