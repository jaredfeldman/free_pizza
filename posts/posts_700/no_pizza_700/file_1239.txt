Hey all,

It's been a while since i've been here, but i kind of really need it. My food plan has run out of money(2 dollars left) and my bank account is less than 10 dollars. 

I'm a stage manager for one of our department shows, so I have very little time to eat at all in these next two weeks, let alone buy anything.

I haven't had a good pizza in a while due to lack of funds, and i really need to keep my energy up for the next week or so.

Is there any possibility that anyone out there could help me?

Thanks!
