Hello RaoP,


I don't usually beg for stuff, but I don't have anything to eat today. I've spent all of my dining hall meals this week since I was busy studying and ate an easy three meals a day. It payed off though because I got an A in two classes. Gah, I'm rambling. The only thing edible I have in my room is coffee. I like coffee. Anyway, why not give this a shot.
