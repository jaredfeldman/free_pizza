Well, I've been a longtime lurker on this website but I rarely use this account.  After surfing the website for a few minutes I came across this subreddit so now I'm a little curious.

Anyways, I'm not here to conjure up a sob story.  My summer has been pretty busy, between working at an unpaid internship since the beginning of summer and taking an online class to graduate a semester early.  I've been applying for part time jobs since May to earn money and I recently got hired at a restaurant.  Things are looking up, but last night I only got 2-3 hours of sleep and I've never felt this exhausted before.  After seeing this subreddit, I'm craving pizza right now more than anything else.  I hope to return the favor and pay it forward!
