Hi thanks for reading our post.  We are a "combined" family of 6 in Hemet.  My husband has 3 children ages 15, 11, and 8. I have my 14 year old son.  We are raising the 4 of them without any help (physical, mental or financial) from the other parents.  We have had to close down our Small Business this year due to the economy and for the first time have had to go on public assistance.  We are struggling to find gainful employment for my husband, but so far have had no luck.  I would be willing to go back to work immediately, however I will be having lung surgery in the near future to find out if I have cancer.  It seems like with the summer here we should be having some kind of fun with our kiddos, but we are not able to afford to take them anywhere so we have made "movie" night and "game" night at home......a pizza would make it a wonderful night....a much needed wonderful night.  Thank you for reading.
