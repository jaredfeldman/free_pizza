If you want to read more, this is the loan request in r/assistance: http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/13pexq/identity_got_stolen_share_and_share_draft/

I'm already going to assume that no one will give me a loan and I'm going to have to ride it out until next week. I could really use a pizza or something that has a high calorie and triglyceride content so Ican eat a slice before work and power through my shift loading trailers. All I have right now is a cup of parboiled rice and without cash and not knowing any of the cooks at local resturants, I need some help.
