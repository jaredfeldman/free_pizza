Minimum wage, overnight part time convenience store/gas station clerk because the economy in WA state is really terrible.  Even for myself, as a thirty year old with a degree (well, a two year but its not nothing).  


My favorite is what my friend has dubbed "girly pizza" (I assume because theres no meat) but I would stuff anything in my fat face gladly &lt;3
