I've been feeling pretty crummy all weekend.. 8 of my friends left on a trip to Japan, and the weather here hasn't been at all great. I just got a job, but I work from home, and now that it's summer, everyone at my house is gone but me. I'm definitely not used to being alone so much. Needless to say, it's all brought my mood down.

I've never done anything like this pizza act before, but it would definitely make my week if someone would send over a cheese and pesto pizza or something.
