I'm stationed at WPAFB. My pay got all jacked up and they took everything back at once. That's a lot of money. Anyone in the air force understands how fucked finance can be. I crashed my car last week, my computer screen broke, my phone isn't working. I'm currently typing this in the tiny area of my screen that still works. I hate asking for charity since I've been poor all my life. But I've had such a bad run the past few weeks and I'm burnt out and flat broke. And since it's my food allowance, (BAS) that is fucked up, I can't eat at the dining facility on base using my military ID. I'd really appreciate some help, guys. If not, that's cool. I have oatmeal. I'm just so tired of oatmeal..

edit: When I get back on my feet, I intend to pay it forward. I believe wholeheartedly in that philosophy.
