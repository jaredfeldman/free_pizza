Hi, my name is Deborah. I used to help run Burlington Emergency Shelter in Burlington, VT. It is a shelter to help provide housing for up to 22 homeless men and women. They only run on donations. No Federal or State funding is used. They rely on donations to provide a meal each night for their guests. Their guests are ordinary people that either lost their jobs or just couldn't work anymore. I personally know what it is like to be homeless as I had went to the shelter in need myself.  I would like to request that someone or some people would provide pizzas for a meal for the homeless. 10 pizzas would be enough. If anyone would like to help, you can find the shelter's website at beshelter.org. It would make alot of someone very happy!
