Longer version of the story. I got engaged a few weeks ago and my fianc√© wanted to visit her mother in buffalo. I let her use my car and she wrecked it. I should have got it back by Monday. Now it could be Friday. I never had rental on my insurance because I never used it. Took the rental back Friday to save money since I was supposed to get the car back Monday. So here I am. No cash on me. I used my last bank check Sunday. Lost my debit card. And the bank is several hours walking distance from me. I really want a hot pizza to improve my mood :( luckily I am not superstitious and taking it as a sign that this marriage is a bad idea because we have so much fun together. Enough about me for now. Let's talk pizza! And yes I would love to pay this back forward one I have transportation again! Thanks!
