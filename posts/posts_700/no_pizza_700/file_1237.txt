Most weeks I am really lucky to make it from paycheck to paycheck.  Usually I am broke by Thursday though.  This week is really bad, my mother has fallen on really bad times.  Mom got a foreclosure letter, myself and my sister stepped up and pulled together some money to keep mom in her house at least one more month.  Now I'm in trouble, I gave away all my food money and I haven't told my kids or my husband, I know I'm going to have to and I will but as of right now my kids are home from school and my husband will be home around 6:30 and I have no food and no money to get anything for dinner.  I promise that I will pay it forward next week if someone has it in their heart to help me out tonight.
