A friend told me that this subreddit exists. That alone has made my evening. I don't really know how this works, but I figured it cannot hurt to post a request.

I don't have much to offer in return, aside from my gratitude and the promise that when I have cash on hand I'll pay it forward. I just recently moved back in with my Dad and step-mom after life took a bit of a turn, and being able to show up with dinner would be great for both them and me.
