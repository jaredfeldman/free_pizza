Happy Veterans Day! I'd like to make a request that someone out there make Ramen illegal. My family and I have eaten nothing but ramen for a week and it has slowly but surely drained everyone in my household. We try dressing it up with canned sauce, but it's still really bad. Can you help a brotha out with something that doesn't taste like wet cardboard tonight? My wife, kids, and myself would appreciate the kind gesture. My kids can also make you a you tube video if you like laughing at silly things. Nothing too graphic or obscene (they're 10 and 12), but I'm sure they can make you a funny video of just about whatever you like within reason. (Daddy has to approve of the theme.)

If you can't help, thank you for checking out my post. I was joking about ramen being a crime - We are thankful to have it, but wish we could have something different. Thank you and hope ya'll enjoy your Friday.
