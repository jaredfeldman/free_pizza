My wife just lost her job, and her medication is failing her bipolar. I've just gotten a crappy grade on yet another test in managerial accounting. Its days like these that keep kicking you in the balls. A pepperoni and sausage pizza would make life so much better.

EDIT: Just found out that students don't qualify for food stamps. Stupidest. rule. ever.
