I got out of the Marine Corps several months ago. I am from Texas, and for the past few months I've been preparing to start college in Florida. The original plan was I would drive here to Florida, take a test, then return home and do my coursework online for the first 90 days, which would give me time to pull the funds together for the move to Florida. Unfortunately, they failed to inform me that the online option only applies to students who do exceptionally well on that test, which I did not. Just for the first trip, I had to sell something that was very important to me. Then I took the test and they told me I either had to give up my dream of becoming a student at their university, or move to Florida immediately. I returned to Texas and did everything I could think of to raise money for the early move, and in a final act of desperation, I sold even more of my belongings. Now I am in Florida, with 2 boxes of clothes, sleeping on a fellow classmate's (who also has no money) couch, with $2.00 in my wallet, wondering what I will do for food for the next 30 days, which is when my Veteran's Benefits kick in and I will finally be able to afford to eat. I would LOVE it and greatly appreciate it if some kind soul would buy me a pizza to enjoy tonight.
