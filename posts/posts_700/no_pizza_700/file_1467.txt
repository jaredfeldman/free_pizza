My gf of 4 years and I just broke up and i'm trying to do any random thing that might help slowly fill the void. Unfortunately I was unprepared for this and it has cost me quite a bit already. If someone could get me even just a small pizza to munch on while I continue to pack up her things from my room, i'd be eternally grateful and return the favor to either you or some other unlucky pizza redditor come pay day.
