Hi, information about the fire [here.](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Morgan-Fire-Near-Mt-Diablo-Chars-1500-Acres-222950261.html)

I'll be stopping by the fire station myself later tonight and will be bringing homemade dishes... I'm thinking probably a few large casseroles or something easy to make in bulk. The thought crossed my mind that this seems like the sort of thing Reddit would love to help with. 

Pizza donations can be sent to the ConFIRE Station #11 at 6500 Center St. in Clayton, CA. The firefighters have been working all day and night since the fire broke out yesterday, and I'm sure they'd appreciate some hot, cheesy slices of pizza! 

To help you out, [here](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=pizza&amp;find_loc=6500+Center+St.%2C+clayton%2C+ca&amp;ns=1&amp;ls=883fdc931eaafb15) is the Yelp page for pizza places near the address. 

Hoping to be able to send at least 4-5 pizzas over there for dinner tonight. Let's make this happen! :)
