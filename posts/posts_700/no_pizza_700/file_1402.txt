Haven't found a real job. Just graduated from Appalachian State University with a double major in Risk Management &amp; Insurance and Economics. Been eating Ramen Noodles for 2 days just ran out. Super broke looking for some delicious pizza. Favorite toppings are pepperoni and pineapple,but would be pumped for anything.
