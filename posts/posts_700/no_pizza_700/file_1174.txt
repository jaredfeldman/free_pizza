Me and a friend have spent the entire night sitting in my dorm room playing Super Mario World. We're on Chocolate Island right now, but just realized that we missed dinner. And, of course, we're both broke. But we really want to 100% this game tonight, so any nourishment would be very nice, and I would love you forever! I'd be happy to take a picture when we beat the game tonight :)
