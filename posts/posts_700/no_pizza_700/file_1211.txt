Basically, a year ago I bought a computer using a credit card offered with a 0% introductory APR for a year. Buried in the fine print was a line explaining that I would be charged 22.9% interest on my initial purchase if I didn't pay in full after 12 months. I didn't realize that bit until yesterday, the one-year anniversary of my purchase (I posted a whole thread about the episode elsewhere). The result - a surprise $500 charge to my card.

And of course all of this happened when my payment plan failed as a result of my financial aid being literally obliterated this year. The state decided to take my grant offers away.

So that was just really rough. I feel awful and scared and screwed and I have no idea how I'm going to to get out of this debt any time soon. Doesn't help that I was planning to go to grad school next year. No idea how that will work out now.

So I'd like some pizza to dull the pain. It would literally mean an absolute ton to me right now. Thank you for reading this.


Edit: I'm in Chico, CA.
