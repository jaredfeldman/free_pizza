My mother abandoned my family (father, sister, brother, and I) back in November and ever since we haven't even had enough money to buy food. We have taken out multiple loans to pay our rent and food banks won't give us Any more food. We spent the day today cleaning out our house and getting rid of more of my mothers stuff. It's been emotionally and physically draining and a pizza for the family would be great.
