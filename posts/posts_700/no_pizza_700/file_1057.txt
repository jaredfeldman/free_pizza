Or I will just be forced to eat food at my work, and we only sell popcorn and pretzels. I hardly ever eat anything other than food from my work because I barely ever have extra money and I feel guilty buying food when I can eat that stuff for free. I make ten cents over minimum wage at my job and had to work 72 hours in the past two weeks so I could pay my rent. I just got paid yesterday and all but $27 of my paycheck has to go towards rent tomorrow. I will only have that $27 for the next two weeks. I feel bad asking for charity but I hope someone out there will take pity on me and buy me something delicious. Thank you!
