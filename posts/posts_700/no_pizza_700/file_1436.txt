Today, has been a shitty day, starting out with me falling asleep during an exam and not even answering 25-30 of the 96 questions after studying for most of the night, becoming ill shortly afterwards and missing my crew practice today due to the fact I missed the shuttle between campuses at 12:00 and missed the carpool for my crew team. On said shuttle I took at 1:00, I left my iPod. Here I sit hoping someone will contact me saying they have it. So ROAP'ers can y'all please brighten my day with a pizza?
