My wife and I have been having a pretty stressful week, and we're very low on food right now.  We're managing, but we're pretty much out of cash until I get paid in a week.  On top of that, my wife had to go to the ER this morning, and she's a little loopy from the medication and the pain.

We would love to just chill out tonight and have a pizza, but that's not an option for us right now.  If there is a kind Redditor that can help us out with our pizza craving, we would appreciate it so much.  Thank you!  :)
