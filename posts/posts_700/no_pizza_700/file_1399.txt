Hey Guys,

My Parents have had a terrible week, and while I would normally buy them dinner at a time like this I'm between paycheques and out of cash.

This week my dad lost his job of 12 years, on top of that yesterday our family Dog passed away (14 years old, so not totally unexpected). They are just really in the "World against us" point of view. They could really use some love from the world at large, and that is where I was hoping ROAP might come in.

If you guys could find a way to send them some saucy cheesy goodness that would be amazing, and come next friday (Payday) I will be passing it on.

Thanks guys!
