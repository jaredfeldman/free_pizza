Hello fellow redditors things have been tough but I know they will get better eventually. Was wondering if a kind and thoughtful soul could help a family of 5 with a decent meal this Friday evening. Food is almost nil around here and will not be able to buy any until Monday. There are 5 of us. 2 adults, and 3 children if anyone can help. We have a pizza hut that is not too far from the house so an egift card would be perfect. I want to thank you all so much for reading my post.

 ((Hugs))
