Hello there. I've been having a horrible time the last few weeks in trying to find any kind of work and the frustration is killing me. My depression (dysthymia) has been hanging over me like a shroud. Some comfort food would help me with this gloomy feeling and also be a fun dinner for me and my mom tonight. 

Incidentally we were helped earlier last year by a fellow NYer. I wish I can find her again so I can return the favor (free graphic design work, house cleaning etc). She gave me hope to not give up and take the easy way out of life's problems.
