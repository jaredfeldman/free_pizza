I found this community through [another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/iphuy/during_an_illness_a_friend_recommended_reddit_to/) and thought it sounded pretty ludicrous, so I figured I would check it out. I pop in, read through the sidebar and notice this tidbit:

"Requestors, please be COMPLETELY HONEST about your circumstances. We donâ€™t mind multiple requestors or asking for pizza just for fun or asking for any reason."

Darn interesting, I figured that the community here would be completely against people who are not starving and out of cash requesting pizza, but I absolutely fucking love pizza, so here I am testing it out

Again, being completely upfront, I am not in any ridiculous need for pizza, besides my undying love for it. I pay my bills every month, I have a decent lump of money saved up in the bank, all is going pretty well, but here is the request anyways!

Oh almost forgot, here is my verification code: ZkmSFEfYfT6b

EDIT: Forgot my general area as well, Detroit Metro area!
