Okay guys so I'm kind of in the mood for some pizza, but I'd rather buy one for someone else! And I'm in an extra good mood today so I want to give two Redditors down on their luck some pizza today, and would also like some for myself. So if some lovely person would like to give me a pie, I will give two redditors of their choice a pie!

Edit: I'm all used up for my offers for now. But I'm still taking an offer for some pizza myself if some kind soul would oblige:)
