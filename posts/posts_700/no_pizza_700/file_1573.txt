My step dad just got laid off. We're spending the day together, and he's really down. We've had a tough year, to say the least. He's always been there for me. He married my mother knowing she had a daughter and has treated me as his own ever since. I was diagnosed with MS earlier this year and I wouldn't have been able to cope without him. We're hungry and broke, and I would love to make him smile with a pizza. He's a great person. I'm trying to restore his faith in humanity, essentially. Hope this works :)
