Hello!

Just your average starving comp sci major. I am rather skilled in photoshop and corel draw though, and will draw or shop whatever you like, my dear pizza champion. You want a cool space desktop background? You got it. You want to ponify yourself? I can do that. You want George Washington leading a bunch of space marines? Man you really want me to work for it, don't you? I'll do it!

Thanks for reading.
