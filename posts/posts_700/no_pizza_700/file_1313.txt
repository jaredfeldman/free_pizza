Well, here is the sob story.

I just moved in with my sister and brother in law.. They bought a new house and need a roommate, and knowing that I am just out of college and looking for work and all that.. they got me to do it. :P

The first week I moved down here, the small amount of money that I had to get through to find a job was frozen in my bank account because Bank of America is such a PoS. I was literally down here a week, and without any notice/phone call/email.. etc. they froze my account and reissued my debit card back to my parents house where I was living (a days trip away, in another state). I was there planning to cancel my account, when they told me I was going to be unable to do so without my new card... that was a couple of days away in the mail. So basically I am broke as shit. :/

I just started my new job down here, but they pay bi-weekly. I just received my first check, but it immediately had to go to the new bank that I have for student loans and car insurance, to avoid late payments. So for the next two weeks I am broke and even have to bum gas money off of my sister to get to work until I am paid, and she cant really afford to be helping me as much as she is already.

I'd really like to do something nice for her in the meantime... so, anyone want to give me a hand?

Sorry for the wall of text... and not really sure of what else to do, just found this awesome subreddit :)
