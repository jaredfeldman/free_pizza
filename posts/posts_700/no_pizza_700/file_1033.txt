I unfortunately am having to spend the holidays alone, which included my birthday, this december. I made sure the fiancee could go see her family that is visiting from korea and i stayed home with our pup and am voluntarily working the holidays so that coworkers can be with family since i am unable to this year. I used my last funds to get the fiancee to her grandpas and won't have any more until after the new year. A pizza would make a really awesome meal for me and would keep me from having to munch on plain rice for atleast tonight and tomorrow :)
