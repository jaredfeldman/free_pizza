Hello, my name is Bret and I'm originally from South Florida, now I reside here in Conyers. I'm here to ask if someone would be decent enough to help me with some dinner tonight or tomorrow while I take care of my kids. I've been separated for nearly ten months now. I drank myself half to death and now I'm working on getting myself back to my feet. I don't have a job and my brother has been paying my rent plus utilities for the last two months. He can't afford to give me anymore cash at he moment, he suggested I try here because you gave him some pizza a while back. I really don't want to feed my kids the same slop I gave them last time. Fish sticks and macaroni, a side of applesauce, they hate it and I practically eat it nightly. I've got two young girls to feed, if someone could help me I'd never forget it. Hopefully that way their mother won't be so hesitant to let them spend the night with me next time they ask to. I'm here if you have any questions or if I left anything out. Hope you'll be well.
