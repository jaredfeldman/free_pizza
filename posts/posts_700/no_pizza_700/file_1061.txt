I recently moved from California to Lynchburg, Virginia...
A very big change of pace. And didn't realize that city life is so much easier. I have a bad knee from a previous injury and didn't know everything would be soooo far apart. Now I need to save for a car.. with no income. So everything I have with me, has to go to hopefully finding a cheap vehicle. 
A pizza would be very nice right now. My luck has not been so great.
