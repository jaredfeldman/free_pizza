So my mom is without electricity for a week so my sister and her friend along with my mom are staying over here so they don't have to deal with this heat. My mom just started her new job and I got fired at mine a week ago :'( (have applied everywhere and am pretty much now harassing places hoping to get hired) I am currently without money and my mom doesn't have enough to buy dinner so I am coming to reddit for some help. I am in an area where there isn't much selection and I don't think the closest place (which is pizza hut) delivers out here but I do have gas to pick it up. Thanks.
