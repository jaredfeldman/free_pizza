I really hate to do this. I am not the type of person to ask people for help...ever. However, I am 21 years old and I live on my own. I make minimum wage and I always make sure to pay all of my bills on time. Unfortunately, once all my bills are paid...there is not always money left over for food. I'm not exactly sure how this all works but I thought it was worth a try. I don't get paid again until next Thursday but I will survive if I don't get a pizza. I have 0$ to my name but it is not a big deal because I don't drive or anything. So really all I need is a little bit of food. If someone would be willing to help me out that would be awesome and I would be totally willing to pay it forward to someone else in need in the future when I am able to. Thanks for reading this. This is a humbling experience!Oh yeah and by the way I do it all on my own with no government assistance and have been since I was 17 years old. Not sure if that really makes a difference or not...
