My friend told me about this and suggested it. I'm recently kicked out and staying with a friend for a while. I literally have less then ten dollars to my name and the last time i ate something was over a day and a half ago. I'm just seeing if anyone could help me out. I'm located in tennessee. Thanks in advance and hopefully someone could help me out
