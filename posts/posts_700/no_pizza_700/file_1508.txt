My German teacher told me about this site yesterday and it took some time to actually find it. I am 17 and want to show my 'rents I appreciate them. My mom is great, but this is mostly for my step dad who is like a real father to me. I just found out that he has been making payments so i can go on a trip to germany with my class this Summer. We don't have that kind of money. i don't have a job 'cause my mom wants me to just worry about school and keeping my grades up. I would love to give them pizza for dinner. If anyone wants to help, i would be greatful. I read everything and if someone can just make sure i do the verification thing right, i would appreciate it. We have 4 ppl in my house, my 'rents and me and 11 year old sister. thanks.
