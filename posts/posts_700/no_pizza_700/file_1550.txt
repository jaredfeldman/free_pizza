Let me start off by saying, I'm taking online classes to become a fully registered nurse, some of my expenses lately have been piling up at home 

(I live with my mother, also a caregiver although she is full-time whereas I'm part-time because of school)


Honestly, I've been financially strapped this last month, and had to cut some expenses on foodstuffs at home, as well as the lunch I pack to work. 

Finished my ham sandwich this morning I packed, and still dealing with the bipolar flare-ups of my patient, if anyone could provide some much needed brain-fuel so I can make it through this day a little easier, I'd really appreciate it :)

I promise to try to gift someone back next month when me and my mother get our paychecks from our patients' family.
