This week has been hectic and very trying. I realize I'm new but I've actually been here a while. Anyway My sister and her children will be here to stay with us in about 2 hours. She is coming from a long way and is leaving a domestic violence situation. She wasn't supposed to be here until the weekend but is coming in today. If she had come saturday like she was supposed to I would have had more time but now I have nothing to feed them and they have been driving 25 hours. I can pay it forward but not til monday or tuesday. I already fed mine so were good but help to feed them would be very much appreciated. If you can help please let me know and ask what you need. Thank you
