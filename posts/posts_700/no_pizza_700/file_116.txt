It's sad I know. I really dislike Optics but it's one of those courses I have to take to graduate (computer engineering), kind of irrelevant for the field I want to go into. I will be forever grateful to whoever the mystery-pizza-sender is and will pass on the random-act-of-kindness to another stranger in some way or another.
