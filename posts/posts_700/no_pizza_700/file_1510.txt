College student and I've lived mostly off of rice, oatmeal and a starbucks gift card I found in my apartment for the past 2 days. I could really use something more substantial but true to undergraduate form I'm out of cash right now. A delicious meat and veggie topped pizza would really hit the spot. If I'm honest I could bum some sandwich money off a roommate and overall I'm hardly in dire straits but I'm sick of hitting my friends up for minor things. Just a college student with a stomach that's as empty as his wallet. I'd love a pizza to study with tonight and to eat cold for breakfast tomorrow morning.
