It took a lot of courage to make this post, and it's very had for me being a husband and Dad to ask this, but my kids would enjoy it.
This will be my first ever Christmas away from my family in 17 years of being married.
I took a job out of town because the economy is so bad where we live. I send home what I can for family. I rent a room so what I send my family is enough to pay the bills. It leaves no room for luxuries like pizza. my family would love a special treat and I would so appreciate it if someone can provide them with a pizza. I am in Atlanta, GA. They are in Southern FL. 

EDIT: I am actually in Kennesaw, GA. which is a suburb of Atlanta. and My family is in Homestead, FL.
