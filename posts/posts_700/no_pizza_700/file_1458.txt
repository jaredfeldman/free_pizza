My dad, my mom, my sister and I live together in a basement apartment with a family upstairs, so we're not the most fortunate either but it seems like other people may need a pizza more so by all means give it them if you want. We get a pizza on Saturdays, my mom doesn't make that much and it'd be cool if I could effectively make it free.

I live in Ontario, Canada. =)
