So we've all heard about what those horrible kids did to Karen.
If you haven't you can find out [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l93wAqnPQwk&amp;feature=watch_response_rev)

I don't want to post Karen's address here, but that video has been getting spammed with the involved parties contact info for hours now.

How awesome would it be for her to be greeted by pizza and sympathy notes this morning?

I know I could have asked for this in a better way. But I just really suck at asking for things.
