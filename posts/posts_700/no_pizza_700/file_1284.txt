I'm short on personal cash, and want to do something nice for my husband.  He has been infinitely awesome to me in the last year and a half, dealing with me being in grad school, student teaching, and miscellaneous other issues.  I still can't grok how much he's done for me out of the kindness of his heart.

Can the pizza spirits bestow a worthy gift to this kick ass husband of mine? He takes his lunch at his desk around noonish. He is a redditor, and probably post-stalks me periodically.  In the interests of keeping his work location secret, I'll post details in PM only.

Thanks in advance!
