We have had a really rough week. The stress and expense has wiped us all out emotionally and financially. I would be so happy if we could enjoy the last day of the weekend together. We are to broke to go out or order in. We can't celebrate Saint Paddy's Day, and I want to bring a smile to everyone's face. Can you help us with some pizza?

PS I know I don't have a lot of activity, I usually just read everything and don't post, but I have been a long time lurker on Reddit.
