The three of us live in a tiny house (dubbed: The Hobbit Hole) and all are bicycle mechanics in the area. Obviously, it is not the most profitable of seasons for us- although I have taken on a job working the door at a local bar (as has another of my roomates), as well as an after school assistant in a town nearby. But Paychecks are two weeks away, and will finally make life easy again! Two of us are finishing getting our degrees. 

It's been a long day, and we Just managed to scrape rent together, but don't really have a great amount of food in the house (save some rice, eggs and oatmeal, that we need to save for the rest of the week and until our next paychecks) 

We Just really want to enjoy a pizza together on a sunday night! 

Thanks RAOP!
