Hey guys, I'm in a tough situation and my mom has no money. She gets paid every second Wed. of the month and I've had Ramen Noodles and Mac N Cheese for the past week for Lunch and Dinner. It would be amazing if someone can help me out. I would be willing to barter with pics of my cat doing goofy stuff.
