I just heard about this subreddit and thought it was the coolest thing ever. Like the title said, I get paid tomorrow and right now my bank account is under a dollar. I've run out of food staples and there is a domino's up the street from my house. I could go pick up a carryout order and it would really make my day better instead of living off toast or buttered noodles another day.
