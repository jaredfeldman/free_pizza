I'm severely craving a: London

Garden City Fungus shiitake, portobello, crimini, button
and oyster mushroom roasted with fresh rosemary on white.
Add our housemade Italian sausage 2 / 3

I'm very much unemployed. I received a letter stating that my unemployment benefits are on hold until I explain why I didn't register with the job service. Of course, I immediately verified that I am in fact registered. Thanks to some glitch in their system I didn't get my unemployment check this week. I'm not starving by any means but I would really love a pizza right now.

How amazing is this pizza, you ask? See for yourself:

I will pay it forward: once I manage to find a job.
