I am an up-and-coming sci-fi and comic book writer who is chronically short on funds and pizza. I also have a fiance' and two kids living with me. For your generous donation of pizza, I will send you either MS Word .doc or Adobe PDFs of two (count them!), TWO short stories of mine. I will also select a high-quality scan of a classic comic book from my collection and share that with you (I'll try to come up with a short list from which you can pick).
