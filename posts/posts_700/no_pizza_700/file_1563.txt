Hey guys. Hungry in RI until payday on Friday then putting most of my check into rent and bills. All I've got in the house are some tortillas and a can of Friskies. My furry little friend and I would be much obliged for a pizza dinner (he likes the cheese!) if there's a cool cat out there to donate. One love!
