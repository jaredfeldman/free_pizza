I have been on food stamps for about the past 10 months because my job only pays a small living stipend, but my food stamps were cancelled last month. They were cancelled when my phone number changed and I didn't convey this information to the correct person at the welfare office apparently. Anyway, I have been working to get them back but it takes forever and needless to say I have been kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel, food-wise lately. 

I would really appreciate a pizza and will definitely pay it forward as soon as I get everything sorted out. Fingers crossed I will be getting a job with a full salary soon anyway!
