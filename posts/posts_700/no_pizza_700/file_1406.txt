Been hungry since the day before yesterday. Just got a job washing dishes at a nice restaurant. No money until the fifth. I have to walk about a mile and a half to work, so any food is good food.  Had some pretty severe back injuries from 2009 hold me up all year in 2010, 200 pounds of insulation fell on top of my head. I would sure appreciate it.
