Long story short, I basically ran out of money back in late June. I spent essentially the entire month of July eating things like empty taco shells for dinner, my roommate's scraps from the night before for breakfast, and some days simply eating nothing. Yes I know boo-hoo, just wanted to say I found this subreddit today and it's one of the best ones!

Again, I do NOT want a pizza, only giving props to an awesome sub. You guys are kewl.
