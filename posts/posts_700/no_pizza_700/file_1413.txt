Hello, my name is Lauren I'm a 21 year old pregnant college student studying for her finals in psychology. I was not fortunate enough to have parents who can help me financially. Anyone who lives in New York knows that monthly metro cards are $104. My paycheck went to that and my cell phone bill. If there is anyone who can help me by purchasing a pizza so I can have some fuel to study for my exams. I attend school in manhattan New York
