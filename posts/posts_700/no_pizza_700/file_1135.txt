I just want to say that hearing about this site today warms my heart.  I was laid off from my job and still trying to find a new one.  I'm only 3 months pregnant but not having any money that could be quite a scare. I'd like to say by the grace of God today there is food in the fridge thanks to food stamps.  But there were definitely times where a pizza would have lifted my spirits, and the fact that there are people here doing just that for others, you are all amazing.  If I had the funds right now to make an offer I would be doing so as well.  But let's just hope I don't need to make any requests anytime soon.  I just wanted to tell you all that you are great people.
