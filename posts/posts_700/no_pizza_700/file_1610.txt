Im 20 years old and living on my own in Texas. i work a crappy job for crappy pay. i finally saved just enough for this class so i can take it and make something of myself, because living like this is making me depressed to the point of mental breakdown. I live on ramen breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I gave my girlfriend my last pack this morning for her lunch at college. If there is anyone kind enough to help out I Promise that friday when i get that paycheck i will return the favor. i never ask anything from anyone unless i really need it but when i do, i always repay my debts.
