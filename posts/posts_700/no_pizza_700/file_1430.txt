I know, I know, I only just registered so I must be lying. Hopefully someone can not prejudge me and possibly believe me. 

Anyway... I heard about this site from one of my online friends, who is in a similar financial situation as me. I was supposed to be paid on Monday, however due to some issues with my bank I haven't been paid and am not really sure when I will be paid. This leaves me with a current balance of Â£2.36 on my debit card (I can provide proof). I ate the last of my food tonight, so I was hoping to get a pizza from here tomorrow. If any more information is needed then feel free and I will post on here or over PM.

Thanks in advance everyone.
