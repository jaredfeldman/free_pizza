Been looking for work for 2 weeks since moving back to my hometown.. Haven't had a paycheque for 2 months. Finally get a lead, two phone interviews, and an interview scheduled for today. I get in there, and the HR manager explains that they "Tried to reach me yesterday" to tell me not to come in. Unfortunately they did not email nor did I have a message on my phone from them, so I just wasted the entire last 24 hours scrambling around and spent the rest of my money getting prepped for an interview I showed up for and didn't even fucking get.

Pizza may in fact be the only thing that satisfies my vindictive rage at this point. Moreso I'm just really, really hungry and haven't been able to eat well lately. The friends I'm staying with give me a bite here and there, but they're very low income with 3 kids and I try to avoid it at all costs. Would seriously appreciate it, and pay it forward!
