I got no one to blame for my situation but myself. I've been unemployed for a couple of weeks now after quitting my job at the mall over some really petty garbage. I was an idiot for doing it and now I've put myself in a place where I'm sinking fast. I've got no money, bills are okay but that wont last long, and I've got almost nothing in the way of food. My family doesn't speak to me anymore because I came out two years ago, so I can't fall back on them. I don't even know where my brother moved to last year, he didn't tell me before he left. 

I go to to school full time at BCC and without income the gas money getting to the campus in downtown Ft Lauderdale three days a week is killing me. I have interviews lined up but there's no telling how long it will be before I get another check. I'm really ashamed of myself for thinking I could just quit and find a new job overnight. I haven't told any of my friends yet but I'm going to have to if nothing changes for me. The sooner the better I know, but I'm just terrified of telling them how badly I'm doing right now. 

I'm asking for a handout in a big way because I've got nothing going for me right now. Even my grades aren't that great this semester. Can anyone on here help me this one time?
