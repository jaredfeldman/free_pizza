I know I am new at this website but my friend suggested me to come on here for the fact of how kind and generous you people are... low on funds will get my paycheck tomorrow but all my check is going to my rent and bills got approved for snap that will not be getting that till next week.. have no vehicle and no way to go to the food pantry there are not walking distance from here and it's 95 degrees outside I've been eating nothing but raman noodles all week and I'm sick of it a pizza would go a long way I will be sure to return the favor as soon as I get extra money thank you and god bless
