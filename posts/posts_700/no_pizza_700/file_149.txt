Hi there awesome redditors!

I'm in need of food :( 

I have been living off mcdoubles since the 25th of last month when my rental company forced us out of our rental 5 days early. Ramen and eggs are getting old, as well as dollar cheeseburgers. 

I would love a pizza to thank a dear friend of mine for the $20 loan to pay my virgin mobile bill, paying him back tomorrow after selling plasma. Would be awesome to share. 

I could repay you in house cleaning if your in the area, or if you need a personal chef for a night, I have references! Or I can draw you some awesomely cheesy artwork since I won't have cash to pay you back.

This is my first time posting in this sub, saw all the kindness and was really touched. Faith in humanity can rest easy on this sub's shoulders. 

Sorry for rambling, just remembered this sub and thought it was worth a shot! Here's to hoping! Have a fantastic day :3
