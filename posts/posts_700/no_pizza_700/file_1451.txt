I live in Victoria BC so it can't be papa john's or stuff like that... we have pizza hut and domino's and uhh.. panagopolous... also i have no digital camera unfortunately to show you how pathetic I look.

I'm sure there are tons of empty promises to be found in these pages but I will buy someone else a pizza(or two) when I get my second paycheck.

This is my longterm account so you can harass me and badmouth me if I don't do it (check my profile if you must but please don't read my messages... a lot of them get downvotes and I wouldn't want you to think less of me).

I don't have children and I will not starve to death without a pizza tonight.

Here's the TIL: it's a neato QM experiment
