I don't know what's going on, but I came home today and there's no check in my bank account. I was suppose to get paid on Friday, but of course it was a holiday. I expected it to go in today, but it didn't. And payroll is closed today, so I won't know till Monday. Netflix took the last $16 out of my bank account yesterday, so I'm negative 10 cents now. I'm pretty sure my money will go in Monday, but until then I'm out of food. Is there anyway somebody can send a pizza, some wings, or anything just to tide me over until Monday? I don't have any kids or anything like that it's just me, but I only go grocery shopping every 2 weeks. So not being able to go yesterday left me with very little to work with. I would greatly appreciate any help anyone could provide. Thank you for reading.
