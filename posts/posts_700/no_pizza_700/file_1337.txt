I just had to slap down two full paychecks for a rental house deposit so this week has been clear out the fridge/freezer time. Unfortunately I've already run out of things to eat. :( I could easily make a medium pizza last me for lunches at work till payday, when I fully intend on returning the favor for anyone else who is in the same temporary bind that I am. Even if I don't get a pizza!

Gotta say I just learned about this subreddit a few days ago and this is an amazing system everyone's got going here. The standup folks outnumber the scumbags by a lot, and I want to jump in and give back to such a giving small community as soon as I'm able.
