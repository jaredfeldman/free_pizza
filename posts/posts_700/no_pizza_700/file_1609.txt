For the life of me, I can't remember my user name once again. I thought it was coltboy to begin with?! Last time I was in here I gave away a couple of pizzas. Now things have taken a turn for the worse with someone in my family having cancer, the bills associated with that, and I have committed to working on my second degree so I'm in college for another round. I'd just love to have some real food if you can help a hardworking, responsible guy out.

OH MAN Nevermind! Whew! I just checked my Papa John's rewards and I have enough for a free pizza! How did that happen?! I swear I thought I only had 10 points! How did I get 20 more points when I haven't ordered pizza in ages?! Looks like I'm good for the moment, folks!
