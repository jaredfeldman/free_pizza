Its been a while since I've been on a site where random people can get together and contribute something real.  I miss the days when Bots in a chat room (that most people goto irc doesn't count, those bots are friendly) were a minority, . 

Myself and room mates do a lot of donation of our time and limited resources, helping those less fortunate that showed up at the Occupi.  
When we have an abundance we try to make the trickle down thing work, but it is tough to do with food, preparing, freshness...

The local Z-Pizza is good.  1 roommate is vegetarian, and 1 is vegan.  They aren't the picky type they just take the meat of and give it to me.

Also if someone at the pizza place drew something funny on the box the we'd appreciate a good laugh. will post pix of pizza box.
