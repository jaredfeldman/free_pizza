I recently graduated from college, moved to a new city then had my bank account hacked by some motherfucker in England. I have literally no money and I don't know what to do. I owe a bunch but I have nothing. I'm looking for a job and I was expecting to find something more than minimum wage after getting a BA but lo and behold that has not happened. Anyways, I'm hungry and cold and homeless. I'm couch surfing and I'd love some food. Here's the difficult part, I'm vegan. I hate to be a beggar and a chooser, but I'd prefer a vegan pizza. The upshot of that is that I'm around Berkeley, California. That said, I'm willing to take whatever, I'm getting hungry enough that my morals are fading. PM me if you're willing to help. Thanks!
