Hey guys I've been completely  for months as my wife had to stop working due to ill health (thankfully she is on the mend and returns to work in the new year).
I would really appreciate if someone could pizza me so I can remember that sweet taste again.
I will either return the favour or if the gifter prefers pizza someone else when I get paid towards the end of the months.
Thanks everyone have a pic of my dog for your time http://www.flickr.com/photos/benjaminbexson/7591908676/
