Im 27 and still living with my mom. I stay with her to help her through her pain and her work, she doesn't really have anyone else so I feel obligated to be here for now. My paycheck alone is going entirely to bills, medication, gas(which is killing me), other.. The one good thing is that the little money I do manage to save is going to my community college, so I am getting an education with the free time i have.. Regardless of all of that, there is nothing in my house to eat right now, and I am starving. Could you please help? It would mean the world to me and my mother right now, and it would definitely take care of 1 problem for tonight.
