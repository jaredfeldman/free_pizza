so. not gonna lie. I've put myself in a bad spot through a combination of bad planning bad, decision-making, and bad luck. Im out of food and currently unemployed. a pizza would be nice instead of ramen. you know how it is, bland food for so long and your just aching for something with flavor. helps keep me from going nuts. my cash is going straight to my rent payment that im really late on. hopefully temp assitance doesn't drag their feet much longer.   also. selling a bunch of stuff to pay bills. comment if interested. will provide pics and stuff.
