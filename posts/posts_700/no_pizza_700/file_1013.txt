Hello RAoP,

Today I knew when I woke up I should just go back to sleep, but against my better judgement, I hopped right up and went to class.

I've been having car trouble for the past two weeks, but I got a new fuel pump put in last week and I was fine.

Until today.

I broke down at a red light on my way to work, where I was hoping to make tip money and eat. This was unsuccessful, as my car broke down again about a mile from my house on my way there. 

I completely wiped out my bank account last week fixing it + the tow  today, so any help you guys can offer would be greatly appreciated!
