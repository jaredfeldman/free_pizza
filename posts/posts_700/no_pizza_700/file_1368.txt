I don't really know how to go about saying this but life has been hard for the last couple years what with poor economy, and even poorer job placement, I haven't enjoyed the simple taste of meat and cheese mixed together with sauce and carbs in almost a year. Life really hasn't been right after the military fucked me over for health problems that they caused during service, so if there are any redditor out there with a heart right now, I'm tired of PBJ and just want some good pizza. If no response, I understand.
