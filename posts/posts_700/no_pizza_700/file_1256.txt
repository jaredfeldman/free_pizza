I am new to Reddit, after reading several threads I doubt I'd have a chance, this isn't a sob story nor am I begging, but today is my daughters 9th birthday, I've been working my butt off just to keep our home, I got my daughter a birthday card and that's all I could afford, although I plan on making it up to her I just want her to be able to have something special today and I can't even provide a decent meal to her today, if someone could help me make my little girls birthday special I'd appreciate it. I feel terrible asking I've always been the independent one, but I really just want to turn this day around. 

I can provide whatever is needed to be provided to make this happen.
