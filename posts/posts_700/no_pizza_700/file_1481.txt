Hey guys, so I started my summer courses and i've been trying to find a job but have had no luck so far. My money situation is looking kinda bad and I would really appreciate it if I could get a pizza to hold me off for the rest of the week. This is my first time so once I find a source of income I promise I'll fulfill someones request. Thank you so much!
