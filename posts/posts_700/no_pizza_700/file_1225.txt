It's been a while actually, I almost have gotten over food until I found a packet of Walkers crisps the other day, not my flavour but I wasn't complaining at all. It only made it worse frankly and I wish I had rationed them. No more money left right now.

Student Finance have been fucking me around and so far the only substance that is going into me is water and tea (with sugar and milk)

I would happily repay this favor to the kind individual in the coming future when I have received my Student Finance loan.

Right now I'm running out of options in terms of food.
