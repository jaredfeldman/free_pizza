Thanks to security deposits and two month's rent and hiring movers, I have absolutely no food and no money to last me until I move at the end of the week. 

I would be super appreciative if someone would be willing to hook me up with a pizza, which would feed me for at least 2-3 days. I have every intention of returning the favor when I get paid on the 31st.
