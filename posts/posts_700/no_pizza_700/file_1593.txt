I'm a life long Arkansan who dearly misses my [Damgoode Pies](http://www.damgoodepies.com/) who was going to Damgood since it was Pie-Squared (or something like that). 




I recently moved here for an IT job and I am currently a full time employee but I'm requesting if someone is driving here anytime soon to grab me a large handtossed Spinato. I dont care if it sits in the sun for 2 days, I'll nuke the shit out of it. I'll pay for it and even give you some gas money for your troubles.
