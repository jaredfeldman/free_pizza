Just an average engineering student doing the full load summer class thing. My food stores have been reduced to a few cans of vegetables, oatmeal, and coffee. I've had a pretty rough week and could use some pizza + faith in humanity to help me power through finals this week. If anyone out there is kind enough to indulge me I would be very grateful. :)

Oh yeah, I'm in northern Minnesota
