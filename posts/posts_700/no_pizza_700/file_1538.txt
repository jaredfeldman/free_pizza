I just got a new job; and between public transportation and having to actually do laundry twice a week, I've been drained of my savings. (Granted I didn't have much left). A pizza would be amazing right now. I'll send decent art in return, at your request! 

and of course, I'll pay it forward once I get paid.

I live in Morgantown WV. I don't know what else to say, except for thanks! This is a beautiful place.
