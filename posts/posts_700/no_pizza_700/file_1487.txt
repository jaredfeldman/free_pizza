The last week has been very tumultuous, at least by my standards. I had to deal with writing several papers for school while treating head lice, the water and internet being shut off, and very little patience. Life has certainly picked up a bit. 
The water has been turned back on, the head lice has been treated, but I'm still stuck writing several papers, babysitting, and working with a limited food supply. I'm not trying to create a sob story, it's just how things are at the moment. I do plan on giving pizza in the future when I am able. Heck maybe I could even give back to you. 
My roommate's daughter is at the sitters for the night, we're getting ready to watch some really bad movies while I work on some papers. We'd like to celebrate the fact that she just gained employment and passed a test. Please help me out so I don't have to live off of one box of rice and a very limited supply of coffee.
