Working hard is not paying off. Got ripped off on a car deal by my own brother. Family is Jehovah's witnesses so no thanksgiving foodz for me. Never had a birthday celebration. I'm 23 yo security guard that refuses to snitch people out for infractions. I smoke weed when I can afford it but I don't drink. I've sent dvds and and other oddball gifts to internet strangers in the past. Honestly, I don't know if this will work, but ill give it a shot because I'm really tired of ramen and peanut butter an jelly sammichs. Topeka, Kansas. Redditor for three years. This account is newer. Like the handle better. Maybe a little much to write. Fuck it. I say what I feel.
