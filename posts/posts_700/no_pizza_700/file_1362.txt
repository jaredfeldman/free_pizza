Hello, reddit! Long-time lurker, first time poster on reddit!

So at the ripe age of 22, I have finally moved out of my mom's house, and into an apartment with a friend of mine. Rent's been paid, bills are paid, hell, I even just got a job! Unfortunately, all our money has been spent on the aforementioned things, and we're down to rice and ramen in the cupboards until my first paycheck. (She's still trying to find a job). So I came here to petition for a pizza in celebration of our new apartment, new jobs, and hopefully a fresh start! 

In return for a pizza, I would be returning a pizza on the day of my first paycheck (The 27th) to whoever is so kind as to get us one tonight. Hell, I'll give one away either way. I am also not above taking funny pictures with the pizza, attempting some sort of art involving the pizza, or pretty much anything else silly that one might request in return for some of that delicious, cheesy-goodness! 

Thanks for considering me, and I hope you all have a grand evening!
