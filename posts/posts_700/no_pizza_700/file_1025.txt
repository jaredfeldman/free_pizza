I'm staying with a friend's family in Northern Ireland, they've been great hosts, so I'd love to treat them but I'm broke and waiting on two unpaid paycheques. 

There are 3 of them + me here, I leave tomorrow. 

Grateful for anyone who helps out. My friend is an avid redditor and it'd make his day to receive a RAOP
