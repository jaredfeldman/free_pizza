i dunno how to beg for pizza. my brother and i are sitting inside, i have some work to do in a couple hours which i will be getting a check for, but i can't cash it. tomorrow I should have worked enough to get my bank account up to zero dollars. i don't have a credit card, so the only way I could really pay it forward is by feeding the local vagrants. not having credit sucks, and mom doesn't get paid til friday. it's sad, but i'll have you know the reason i'm sitting here hungry is because I do favors for people and not all of them are able to express their gratitude in the form of money. totally missed out on the free artisan pizza, that would have been epic. 

i'm in New Orleans area. my skitzo brother will likely record a rap for you which you can post if u like it. and i'll upvote it.

that's the iTunes code, I'm not hungry I had a booger and fingernail pasta. my bro could still use the pizza and maybe a pack of cigs. I'll delete this post later today... gotta head back over to this lady's house I think she has a rootkit. fml.
