Things haven't been great, honestly. They haven't been horrible but, well fuck it.

I'm a broke college student. I lost a lot of money on a bad business investment (not as sketchy as it sounds though) and I've had to turn to sketchy odd jobs and prostitution in order to pay rent.

I mean I'm getting a new job with my college soon, which is great. But that doesn't even start until...later &gt;_&gt;

Alright so my life isn't that bad. But seriously though can I please have a pizza? There must be some other white, too rich for student aid, too poor to pay for college (literally 90% of my college is being paid for on loans) person who understands my plight.

Also I know my username says ConservativeVictory but if it helps my case I voted for Jon Huntsman and then Ron Paul out of spite to Romney. Actually voted for Gary Johnson even though I'm really not that far right at all just because I didn't care for Romney and Johnson was a pretty good at being a Governor imo.

Anyways srsly though please get me food =/ I literally have like, 3 ramen left.. not sure what happens after that.
