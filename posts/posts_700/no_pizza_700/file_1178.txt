Paul is 70, Stones are (rumored) to stop touring in 2013.  I'll post pics with pizza and b-day candles &amp; will give KB the crust.... I'll even go out to Buddy Holly's grave and take a pic with the box!  KB LOVES the crust.  Help a OLD hippeh chick celebrate.  KB is the rottweiler and she NEVER gets crust anymore....  No check until friday and the s.o.b. that promised me he would call about the job, DID'NT.  New here, REDDIT-ly challenged.  WILL pay it forward!
