I have no noble cause to rally any givers to. I am not in absolute need, but I am completely broke and in debt, with a somewhat empty fridge. I am not starving, I have bread and canned goods. I mostly just want some pizza, because pizza is awesome and I'm hungry. Getting over a sunburn so bad I couldn't walk (swelling), if that helps.


All in all, there are better people to get pizza for. But I still want some.
