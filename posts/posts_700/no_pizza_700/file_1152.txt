This is the first time I've requested pizza on RaoP and I have seen that you guys don't love sob stories all the time so I'm going to keep it brief.

Girlfriend has given me chickenpox, I'm a student so have no money and I live in North Wales. And no I didn't have a problem with the flooding but I can't go home if I wanted to because the main route to home is still flooded.

I would love some pizza, and it would really brighten up my day.
