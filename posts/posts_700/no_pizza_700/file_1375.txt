Hiya, I apologize for not really being a part of the reddit community, but I browse from time to time. Please don't hold it against me. Anyways, here's the deal. It's Saturday, I have a little over $5 in my bank account, nothing but roommate chow at the apartment, a flat tire on my bike, and it's so windy and dusty out that the sky is pretty brown right now. 

By trade, I am a freelance writer. Sometimes it pays fabulously, the last few months not so much. But I understand the give-and-take of economy and I'd much rather put something together for you than accept charity. So I'm thinking a page of whatever you want for a medium pizza. Haiku about Thundercats, a love poem for your girlfriend to smooth over the fact that you got really drunk last night, I can get you started on that paper you're putting off, or just the word butt as many times as I can fit on the page. And none of that copy-paste bull crap either, I promise to type each one of those butts individually and by hand.

Maybe you want more than one page. These things happen. And I happen to be able to put away far more pizza than is probably healthy for me. Or I might want mushrooms AND pepperoni. We can work it out.

Just about the only thing I won't write is a signed confession that I was the one who committed that murder the cops are getting closer to solving. Let them figure it out on their own.

If you order a pizza for me, I promise to not only write for you, but will also enjoy said pizza ravenously while playing the video game of your choice, assuming I have it in my collection (odds estimated at 1 in 15). Can provide photo proof of brown sky, flat tire on bike, or other reasonable requests if needed. Will gladly provide gratuitous photo proof of pizza enjoyment if desired.

Thanks RAoP!
