I am completely broke right now and have no food to eat except an old can of corn. The last of the money I had from my last couple shifts had to go into my gas tank so I could actually go to work tomorrow. I would be happy with any kind of pizza whatsoever(I don't really like pineapple but beggars can't be choosers). I am not sure what I can offer in return I can take a picture of myself acting a fool or maybe my cat who has a split paw. If you can find it in your heart to help me I will be forever grateful.
