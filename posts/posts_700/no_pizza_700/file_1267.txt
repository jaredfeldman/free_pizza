Hey all, I'm a poor college student(what a surprise) posting here hoping to get some pizza. why do I need pizza, you ask? well, it's midterm week, and as a Senior in IT, i'm fucking stressed. I just learned today that my parents are getting a divorce, which was honestly not a surprise, but it still kinda hurt. I usually get by on shitty overpriced Cafeteria food but I just lost my shitty job mopping floors at Shaw's a couple weeks ago and there are ~no~ other jobs in my podunk little vermont town. All I ask is if someone can send some breadsticks or a Small pizza for me and my equally hungry Roommate, it would be mightily appreciated.
