So today is my older brother's 18th birthday. We were looking forward to making him a big birthday dinner and everything. Well every year on his birthday he's been stuck at the doctor's office or the dentist. This year it's happened again. My sister has pneumonia in her left lung and is in the ER so no birthday dinner for him sadly. It'd be nice to get a pizza or two for him to celebrate.

And if you can't give a pizza, prayers &amp; best wishes for him and my sister are just as much appreciated. Thanks guys!
