Copy pasting my post I made in /r/RandomActsOfPizza before I realized there was this sub. Figure I'll have a better shot here based on subscriber totals. 

&gt;Just used everything I have to pay off my overdue rent, as well as this months, and I'm left with nothing for groceries and like four uncooked burger patties and a small Tupperware container of rice left.

&gt;I'm waiting on a friend who is out of town to come back to give me money he owes me so I can go grocery shopping, but... I've no idea when that'll be. I could really use some pizza when said burgers and rice runs out to help stave off hunger for a while. It'd be very, very much appreciated.
