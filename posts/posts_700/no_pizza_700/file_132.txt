Her name is Chinadoll and she apparently had an enormous hairball stuck in her intestines.  We had taken her to the emergency vet clinic and they did a bunch of tests on her and all of them were really expensive, and then they told us that she would need surgery (which was $2000).  She is home and getting back to being her usual rambunctious self, but of course she should be lying down and recuperating.  We're all dead tired due to sleepless nights of waiting around at the clinic and worrying about her, of course, and could really go for some pizza.

As for the story behind Chinadoll, she is a huge, fluffy, grey cat.  She is sometimes very sweet and loving but usually cruel, stubborn, and dominating.  She is always far smarter than us, very energetic, and very beautiful.  She has been described as a "probability cloud of evil".  As a kitten, she was rescued from being hanged by some young assholes.  My SO and I love our four cats as our children, and the other two people in our house see them as family, too.

If you want to treat us to pizza, there are four people here and we like Cottage Inn.  Other pizza places would be fine, though.  An e-gift card would be the best for this, I think.
