Well, 

I have been broke for the past month or so and have been sustaining myself on a diet of Chef Boyardee and Hot Pockets. I do still have a can of Chef Boyardee left, but it's stomach churning just to look at. I'd just really like a hot (not microwaved) meal. 

The good news is that I will be getting some money tomorrow, and will be happy to, at the discretion of the pizza donor: 

1) Pay it forward with another pizza gift on this here subreddit OR; 
2) Send my donor a fully functioning, used, Xbox 360 hard drive (20gb). 

Verification provided upon request. Thanks!
