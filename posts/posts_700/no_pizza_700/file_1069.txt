Hi guys. Situation as following: Im gonna get a surgery tomorrow, and 2 days after that get chemotherapy. I want to eat my favourite pizza once more before going to hospital, because the food there is just awful, and I will not be allowed to get any food on my own for like a month(because I got none immune system at all). 
I`ve got no money at this moment, and my mum denies to buy me one because she did cook something too.
So, I got no big hopes but I`ll give it a try here :D .

Also at this moment im having a Venae Needle in my arm, can take a photo of it and my nick or whatever you wish.(they need it for tomorrow so they can make me sleep before they get access to my heart).

Btw. I doubt anyone is here from germany, so I have paypal also, I would need 8â‚¬=~15$ or something.
