Hello, I'm new to this subbreddit and I'm not exactly sure how this works. Essentially, I'm a broke college student with classes starting this Tuesday. I would like to get pizza for my family tonight just to be nice, but I can't afford it with the cost of books. 3/5 people in my family have celiac disease and cannot have regular pizza without doing serious damage to their body.
