I haven't eaten all day (except for muh cereal, but it was the nock of publix brand chereioes. Oh I also ate publix icecream, but someone left it was a milkshake. Not to mention the fact that I dropped the container spilling i....)

wow I just realized how many food related accidents I've had today. Anyways I dropped the container and spilt melted icecream all over the kitchen floor. But at that point I didn't care because my bagel was done. It burned in the toaster. Hurt but not knocked down I scraped the black off the bagel and put some delicious salmon cream cheese on it (if you don't have salmon cream cheese get some it sounds extremely gross, but is actually pretty decent). Finally my little brother (14) tried to snatch my bagel out of my hands. He knocked it into the air luckily I bobbled it enough to regain control of my delicious snack. Unfortunately, I also bobbled cream cheese all over my arms and face. but fear not! I took revenge by sneaking up on him from behind and slapping a large amount of cream cheese on his face (the good kind).

yeah. That was my day today (not to mention all the college apps I did). This is why I deserve a mushroom pizza. Cheers.
