I am starting to see a trend of some of these new accounts try and play the 'I am a cute female on the internet' card. I sit here contemplating sending someone a pizza, but notice more and more potential manipulation and then change my mind.

This is random acts of pizza, and honestly the person who gets a pizza from me is not going to be someone trying to get some free stuff this way.
