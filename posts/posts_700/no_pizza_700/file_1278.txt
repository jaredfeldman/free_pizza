Hello. A bit about my situation: i lost my job the day after xmas. Contract expired, customer did not renew (they went with another security contractor). My funds have ran out while hunting a new job, at a horrible time of the year to be job hunting. Any assistance would be paid forward asap. 
 Edit: 8-1-13. 1511
 I have a job interview thursday. woot!
