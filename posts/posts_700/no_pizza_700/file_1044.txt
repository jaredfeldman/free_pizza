I sort of survived all day yesterday on a jar of crunchy peanut butter, and most if not all of my income is going to a lease that I have to finish for the next two months. I really like playing music, skating, and playing video games, but I don't really have the energy right now. If you guys could help me out, I could probably make the slices last me the week. Thanks for your time.
