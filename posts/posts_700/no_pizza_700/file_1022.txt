Currently studying for my second final and haven't been eating well (mainly just once a day) Most of the time it's maruchan ramen, sometimes those $1 banquet meals if I feel like i deserve it...My Bank of America account has literally 2.67 left! D:

I would be eternally thankful to the stranger that buys me a nice hot pie of pizza! In the future I promise to return the favor!

Also if you need any sort of validation I'm be more than happy to give it to you (to the best of my ability)
