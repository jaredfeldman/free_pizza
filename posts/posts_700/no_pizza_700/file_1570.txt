i have been homeless for almost a year now and up until now ive either been able to get some help from a friend or been able to find a job for a while unfortunately in march i was fired from my job at subway because they found out that im homeless so i had a little money saved up since then i have been looking for a job and eating ramen about a week ago my tire popped after i had perked for the night so i can't drive it and luckily i have an old laptop i can use to access internet. completly by accident i found this website and since i ran out of ramen a couple days ago and havent eaten i figured why not ask couldn't hurt to try. thank you and god bless
