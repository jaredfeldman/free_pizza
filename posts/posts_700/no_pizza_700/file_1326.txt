Totally understand I'm not as down in the dumps as some people who post here, but I'm in between jobs, finally leaving the retail environment and would love to celebrate.  Unfortunatly I'm between paydays and can't really do anything.  

Hoping to get a pizza or two and invite some friends over,  I will reimburse you with a DOTA 2 key for each pizza, max of two!
