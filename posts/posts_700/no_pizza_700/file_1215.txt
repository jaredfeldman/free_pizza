Well here's the tedious lifestory this morning both my parents left for work, and towards the afternoon i felt famished so i went to get some and i saw i only had £5 i though it'd be enough for atleast a burger or something so i tried ordering one but they said it has to be over £10 for delivery, and i can't go out as mum took my key :|
can anyone feed me with pizza in return i give you ESET NOD32 Anivirus 5 key :D

TL;DR: £5 Not enough, buy me pizza get ESET NOD32 Key
