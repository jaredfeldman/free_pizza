I just barley made my rent this month with literally the last cent from an old coin jar I had. I'm greatly relieved, yet oddly depressed looking at my now empty coin jar. 

Is anyone willing to help cheer up a broke redditor with some pizza while I figure what my next step is to be? In any case, thank goodness for the power of the penny and thanks for reading!

To Mods: Thanks for posting a link /r/Food_Pantry in the sidebar. Never knew about that! Might be a lifesaver this month! :D
