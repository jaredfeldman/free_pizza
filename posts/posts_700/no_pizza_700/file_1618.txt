Hello there RAOP! I am a student in good old blighty, and due to a cock up by student finance, I am yet to receive my loan, leaving me with no money. :( 
My rent is due in a few days, and that is the least of my worries, as today I've only eaten a semi melted Toffee Crisp :(
I of course will pay it forward, as soon as my loan arrives!
Help me Reddit, you're my only hope..
