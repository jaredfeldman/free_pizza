My extremely supportive boyfriend has allowed me to follow my dream, and supports the both of us with his salary. I have a vintage store on Etsy, and within the last year I've found it's truly my passion.

Without a doubt, my boyfriend is one of the most kindhearted and caring people I've ever had the honor of knowing. He gives me support and tells me that my happiness is worth us counting pennies. He allowed me to search for, and find my passion.

We live a life without credit card debt, and choose to pay with things upfront in our daily lives. We pay our bills, but do not have any spending money. We spend every penny simply on our necessities, so much so that we've only been on two real dates in our 10 months of being a couple. 

I would really appreciate any kindness to repay him with a warm and toasty pizza! I can easily verify who I am, and would greatly appreciate and kindness from reddit!

Thank you and have a great weekend everyone!
