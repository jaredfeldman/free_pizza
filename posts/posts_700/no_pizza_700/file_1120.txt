My fiance Chris and I (Laura) just moved across town to a new apartment. Unfortunately we got screwed over by the moving company (quoted us around $30 for the truck, costed $80 -.-;) and we barely have enough money to get by until pay day (Aug. 1st). I can barely move let alone cook anything and Chris is in worse shape than I am. We would greatly, greatly appreciate even just a single cheap-o cheese pizza so we can eat. Please help. :(
