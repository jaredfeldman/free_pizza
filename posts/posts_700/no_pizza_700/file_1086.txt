Hello, I was wondering if maybe somebody out there could help me out...I know these people that got kicked out of their house, they were going to take their dog to the pound since they themselves had no place to live and i didnt want the dog to be put down or live out in the cold in utah (he would die he is tiny), they were feeding him horrible food and couldnt afford dog food so i spent of the last of my money on gas and dog food and a leash for him and now i dont get paid until thursday

was hoping somebody could help me out and i can pay it back this friday 

I dont know if this will work but here is a photo of the little guy, his name is otis: (his name was gizmo but i changed it)
