...I've spent my weekly allowance on other necessities like bed sheets, toilet paper, etc. I had enough money left over to have food the day before yesterday. I didn't mind not eating yesterday since I was asleep due to the exhaustion from moving. 

I daren't ask my parents for money because I know money is very tight and being the over loving parents that they are, they'd stop eating for a week if it means I'm comfortable and I just cannot do that to them. If anyone is willing to send me a pizza, then great. If not, then thanks for actually reading all this :)

I'm in Bristol btw

Thanks
