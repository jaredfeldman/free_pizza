I am really encouraged by this subreddit but am still a bit disbelieving that random strangers are so willing to help one another.  I am a major pessimist and, while I try not to be, I almost always tend to think the worst eventuality will happen at any given moment.  So, here we are.  I am supposed to start online classes for my master's degree on Monday and I actually have to ship my computer off for repairs because it is seriously messed up and the warranty ends in 10 days.  :( Sigh, it's not so much the inconvenience of going to the library, etc.  It is just that I feel like anytime I take a step forward, I get kicked two steps back.  

A hot pizza on a Saturday night would pick up my spirits a bit and my husband would also definitely enjoy it.  He works as a cook and is always exhausted once he comes homes.  The last thing he wants to do is cook dinner and I am a BIT of a kitchen nightmare. 

Thanks guys!
