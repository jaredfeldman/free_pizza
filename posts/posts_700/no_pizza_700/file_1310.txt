Been packing all day so I can move into a new place tomorrow, there'se no food in the house, and my funds are drained thanks to the new place's rent and deposit.  I get paid Friday so I will pay it forward / return the favor if anyone is kind enough to feed me tonight =)  I live around the downtown Los Angeles area.

Also, as a bonus I am a Computer Science major here at school, so if you'd like I can offer some computer support if you are having any issues you've been meaning to check out (no promises on being able to fix it, but you'd at least get a free diagnostic without taking it anywhere).  Just thought I might throw that in there as an extra incentive =)
