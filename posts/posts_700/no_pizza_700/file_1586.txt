hey there RAoP,

i'm an undergraduate Computational Media major at Georgia Tech, which pretty much means i'm a Computer Science major except I specialize in things like film, user interfaces, video games, stuff like that. i'm directing a fifteen-minute horror movie for my english class, and i've been sick the past couple of days (which is a double bummer because we've had monday and tuesday off) so i'm in OVERDRIVE mode. i have all the work i can possibly do for tonight done and i'm just exhausted and still a little under the weather. i have also forgotten to eat today, and my meal plan is full for the week so i can't go to the dining halls :(

if there are unfulfilled [REQUEST]s from mothers with children or people who are literally starving please get me off the front page as fast as you possibly can, but if anyone can spare a pizza for a starving artist that would be awesome. i'll even put you in the credits of the movie under 'special thanks' if you want :p

i can provide a link to the course website as well as a picture of me outside the dorm as verification.

pizza or no pizza, have a great night, everyone!
