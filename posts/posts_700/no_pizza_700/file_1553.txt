I can get in my chair for a few minutes to get to the door but not much else. Pretty hungry and when my financial situation is figure out will pay it forward to someone else in need. Verification would be gross but doable. The sore was healed but opened back up recently which is pretty tough to deal with. I am bound to a wheelchair and the wound is on my inner right thigh.
