Hey guys. This is the first time Ive ever posted here. This is my throwaway though and not my actual reddit account.

Anyway I was wondering if someone could hook me up with a pizza? Im 21 years old and on government assistance (I live on my own and go to school). Ive been having a kind of shitty week. It would be pretty cool to have something to eat, as it'll be a couple days before I'll have money.

Thanks.
