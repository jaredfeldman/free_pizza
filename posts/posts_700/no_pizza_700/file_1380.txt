We have our son who came to visit and we are so embarrassed as we didnt know and dont have much to pick from. We live on a limited amount of food a week for a family of 3 . So we are asking for a pizza for 4 . We would really enjoy it and would love to sit like old times with our son and talk . I am the only one working as my wife has Lupus and cant work anymore. So living on one pay check is very hard . There is nothing left for a yummy cheese pizza . We havent had a good pizza from Papa johns in ages ! We would really enjoy it for Sundays dinner . Thank you
