Long time reader, first time poster.  Forgive me if there's a better place for this, but I thought I'd try here.

I'm a divorced dad with limited funds.  The ex is remarried and in a better financial place.  Not trying to compete with her, but I hate always telling the kids we can't go out to eat.  I have $60 in Fandango cash that I basically have nothing to do with right now.  The kids and I have seen what we're going to see until the summer, and I figured maybe I could trade it for a gift card somewhere.  As I said, I've followed this site for a long time, but I've always been too proud to ask for help.  This way I figure I'm not taking a handout.  What I'm hoping is to get 2 $25 gift cards, and I would give $30 in movie cash for each one.  If you're not familiar with Fandango cash, you can use it at any theater that accepts fandango, and it never expires.  You can look on Fandango.com for more info.  

I know there are a lot of great people on here, and I'm hoping some of them would enjoy going to the movies :)

Have a great day!
