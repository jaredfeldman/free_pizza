Hi!
I'm new to RAOP but this subreddit looks wonderful. I'm not exactly sure how this all works, but my name is Johnny and I am hungry. Normally I would get myself some food, but I have no money tonight.  I wouldn't normally ask for someone to buy me pizza but the alternative to RAOP would be to not eat tonight, so might as well give it a shot. I live in Venice, CA. 
If anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated, and regardless when I have money I'll be back to here to help someone else out.
