Hi, RAoPizza'ers! Just as it says above, I'm an unemployed recent college graduate with loans on top of loans to pay. There's nothing to eat at my house, and I sure am awfully hungry. If anyone would be willing to buy me a pizza, I would be so extremely appreciative, and would repay your kind deed once I get back on my feet.
If it's any motivation, here is a picture of me about to eat a piece of paper (and verification that I'm not a scammer or troll):

Thank you for reading! This would make my week.
