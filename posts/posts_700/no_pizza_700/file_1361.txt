Hello, I was just on facebook telling my friend how hungry I was and he sent me the link for this site since he knew I loved pizza. I would normally be having a pizza right now but I didn't get paid like I thought I would yesterday, I'll be getting paid tomorrow. I worked 21 hours to help build a chain-link fence for my friend's father's construction crew (he only needed me for a part-time status). I already ate all the food I got (whole wheat spaghetti with a bottle of paul newman's own spaghetti sauce)

This service seems to work and I would be delighted to help pay it forward once I get paid by offering someone else pizza, too.

I am in Cupertino, CA.

Thanks for your time.

PS I used that verification in the 3rd step on the sidebar.
