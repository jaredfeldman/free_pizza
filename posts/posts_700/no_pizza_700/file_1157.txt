There are 2 families on my block that each have a young boy. The family to my front is leaving to return home tomorrow (self deportation after a traffic stop). I've had a blast the last 2 years watching these kids grow up and play together and feel like shit that they are likely never going to see each other again. They are 5 or 6 I'm guessing.

Will someone please get these kids a last meal to share? I know illegal immigration is a Huge issue in the US, but fuck man, we're talking about children, and the kid leaving has never been out of Florida, let alone been to Mexico.

Thanks.


Eta: In Florida and we have Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Papa John's in the area.
