It's been pretty hard this past month food wise, and for the past two weeks I've eaten maybe one meal a day, and the term meal is loosely used. It'd be really nice if someone could bring in the new year on a positive note for me. I'm open for paying back however you choose, or not at all, it's entirely up to your discretion.
