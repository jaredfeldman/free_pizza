Hi there, my oven broke a while ago so naturally ordered a new one. Someone corgi registered needs to install it and with payday not being till tomorrow I have been cooking on an open fire in my garden, don't get me wrong I loved doing it....for a while. My family is away for the night and I can't bear to cook on a fire again lol. Some pizza would be awesome. Naturally I would return the favour to someone else in need of pizza tomorrow evening. Thanks fir reading guys and girls.
