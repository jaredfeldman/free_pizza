My wife and I are both full time students. She has an all-day class today and will be out of the house until 7:00 PM. I'm a graphic design student with 2 major projects to finish by Monday. 

I feel terrible for my kids (7, 5, &amp; 4). They are doing so good entertaining themselves while we get ready for finals, and I wish I could do something for them. But we are completely broke (students, after all). Would someone mind treating them to some delicious pizza?
