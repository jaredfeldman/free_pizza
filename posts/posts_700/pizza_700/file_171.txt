My children and I have had a hard time lately. I am financially broke since my ex (the kids dad) has stopped paying child support. We have been living off what we get from the local food give away for the last month. We are in Eastern Iowa. Any help is appreciated. Thank you in advance.

TY logicday for helping us! My children and I appreciate it!
