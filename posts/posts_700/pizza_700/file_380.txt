So my husband has gone to Michigan to be with his father who is dying from cancer. He is waiting until his first paycheck then getting our house and a u-haul and us lol. I am leaving my mother and sister behind, and am a bit nervous about it. So until I get there, everything is a bit limited! Would anyone like to spoil me and my two toddlers to a pizza dinner? =D

BTW, this is NOT a crises for food, we have plenty in the kitchen, just wanted something a bit more fun =D
