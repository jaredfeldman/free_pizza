I am part of a team of four AmeriCorps VISTAs about 45 minutes south of Cleveland Ohio, and we only make around $900 a month. If you don't know what AmeriCorp is, check out www.americorps.gov. Two of us work on a financial literacy program that offers classes on banking, credit, etc., and myself and another person work on a program that helps empower individuals to become self-sustaining through education and a community based mentorship program.

I would really like to get my teammates pizza for for lunch today. I'd get us all pizza myself if I could afford it! We typically all bring in our own lunches, but sandwiches, bagels, and leftovers are getting a bit old. 

Thanks in advance! I can, and will, provide a picture as a thank you.
