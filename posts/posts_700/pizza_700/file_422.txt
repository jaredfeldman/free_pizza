I don't have a sob story or any of that kind of stuff people usually have around here. I'll be honest. I couldn't save any money for food since Christmas is around the corner and we all know that means gifts for all... Including rent. Sigh.


I would really appreciate the help if someone could lend a hand. I get paid tomorrow so I can repay it forward to someone here in need just as I am today.


Any Aussies can lend a hand? :S
