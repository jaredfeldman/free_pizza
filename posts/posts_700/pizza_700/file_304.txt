I am not starving, I do not NEED this, and I can well afford some pizza because I live at home. But I want to participate and would absolutely pay it forward for the fun of it. I think the only place near here is Dominoes, and my GF will be coming over in a few hours and we are going to just watch a movie, hopefully with pizza lol.
