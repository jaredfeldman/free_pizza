Well, my rent is paid up until June, and [my cats](http://i.imgur.com/T7pmOh.jpg) have food. I just ate my last package of ramen, and I forgot to save some cash for me to eat!

I by no means need or deserve a pizza. I couldâ€™ve planned out my spending a little better. [My fridge is empty](http://i.imgur.com/IXViD.jpg), but I do have some pasta or rice I could make.  Getting a pizza would be the highlight of my spring break. And when I get paid on Friday, I would love to pay it forward.
