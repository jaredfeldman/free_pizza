My coworker and I unfortunately got stuck with the slowest day in over 3 months with nothing to do for the next 5 hours but stand at the desk in case any guests need our attention, but that becomes less likely the later it gets. Any help to feed our hungry low paid stomachs would be very much appreciated.
