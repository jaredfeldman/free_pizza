Hey guys, I was just in the r/assistance part of reddit and was linked to this subreddit. I dont really know how this works as it is my first time, but i'm hungry. I can give you the long story, but we all have ours. Basically im so broke its sad. I live paycheck to paycheck and I have overstretched myself this week and im hungry. I have rice, but 3 days of rice and even the most desperate of people will grow tired of it. (I also have been eating it plain due to no soysauce) :/

If anyone could send me a pizza I would be more grateful than I can express. I can pay it back as well, but not until next friday when I get paid. 

thanks
