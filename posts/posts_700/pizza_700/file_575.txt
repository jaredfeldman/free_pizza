Hey all, I hate that I have to be this guy, but I know you people are incredibly generous. My name's Chris, I'm 20 and I live on my own (in good old Cincinnati, Ohio). I am out of money and food (I literally have 35 cents and a can of beans /no hobo). I'm currently applying for all sorts of jobs so I don't have to be in this situation for long but I'm still waiting for something to come of it. On a random sunday evening, a pizza would be mighty fine.
