Hi. These last two weeks have sucked, and I would really appreciate not worrying about one thing--namely, food--after all the torrential bad events I've experienced. In short:

* Moved out of my dorm, physically exhausting myself by lugging all my physical belongings up three flights of stairs. 

* Learned my grandma has likely-fatal leukemia

* Got rejected.

* Car broke down. Towed for all the money in my checking. Problem not found, magically starts running again.

* Had to miss a week of work due to lack of transportation--less money, more problems

* Discovery that I can't cook well, and I don't have the cash to spend to improve my cooking skills (read: buy a cookbook, or a good square pan, or microwavable dinners).

* My other grandmother, the gentlest woman I will ever meet and the guiding role model in my life, passes away suddenly. 

* Car breaks down again. AGAIN. Fortunately, it magically restarts AGAIN, and I don't have to have it towed. But it's almost guaranteed now that whatever is going wrong is going to be expensive.

* I get a sunburn from the funeral, and a mysterious rash from apparently holding a rabbit.

* Grades come back. I am officially beneath the required GPA necessary to keep my scholarship. 

Aside from the food courtesy of the funeral, I haven't had a decent meal in maybe a month due to stress, finals, and lack of cooking skills. I would like to have a few days where I don't worry about hunger.
