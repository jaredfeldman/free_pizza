Not too much of a sad story, just an overworked, incredibly stressed out mama here who is very tired of eating Ramen for ALL the meals. Had a really crazy week, especially yesterday... And would love the relief of not slaving over hot stove for the kids dinner &amp; then eating Ramen myself.

Never done this before, so I don't quite know what else I need to do. But if anyone is willing to help... I can pay it forward on the 10th :)


Ughh I thought I put this in the title. Sorry! I'm in Kansas City, MO :)
