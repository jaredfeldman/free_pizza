My wife and I are broke right now due to bills and having a 6 month old (kids are expensive), she's air force and deploys to South Korea for a year next month, and it took all our extra money preparing everything and we've been scraping meals together, pretty much only have ramen and canned fruit right now. A pizza, even a cheap simple one, would really be awesome right now, and I promise next pay day I'll pizza someone in return to forward the favor. If no one replies I completely get it! I can provide some kind of proof if requested. Thanks everyone!
