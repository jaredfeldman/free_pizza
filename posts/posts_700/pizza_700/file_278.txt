I came across Reddit a few days ago and I hope that someone out there can help me surprise my family. My wife and I ended up losing our jobs, and things have been pretty hard for us. Last night I went without eating so that my children could eat. As a man, I feel like I'm failing my family and I'd like to give them a meal that isn't "instant". If anyone can make this happen, I will borrow my neighbors camera and make a video for you. Everyone will be home today at 5:00 PM EST. We are in Plainfield, New Jersey.
