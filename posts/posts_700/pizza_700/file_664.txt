I'm on my own and have no family to speak of, I'm alone in Florida and have $5.48 left to my name for gas to get to and from work. I lost my job due to downsizing but thankfully got a new one soon after - the only problem is they pay you bi weekly. I started on the 9th of this month and don't get my paycheck until this Thursday - the 26th. I only have enough bread left to have one sandwich a day until then. I want nothing more right now than a Domino's Philly Cheese Steak pizza and a 20oz bottle of cherry coke and I swear to celebrate my first paycheck by giving someone else a pizza as soon as I can. Please help me before I start to cry strawberry jelly.
