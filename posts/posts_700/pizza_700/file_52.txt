My friend is visiting from out of town, travelled through snow to celebrate new years together and visit Monk (the cat).  We're broke and happy but also hungry right now! We would be grateful for a little help to make this a happier (and less hungry) new years eve!

Will post pictures of the Monk enjoying the pizza.
