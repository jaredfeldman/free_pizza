So I made this throwaway because I just feel bad about having to post here, but it's a last resort.  I've been unemployed for a few months and my cash is just winding low.  I'm in the midst of classes that have been taking up my time and preventing me from finding a new job and I'm starting to really stress out about having to pay rent in ~10 days.  I'm not expecting anything, but I figured I'd try for a pizza.  I have a verification code.
