Hey R+, So here i am in africa for the past few months. About 2 weeks before i left for Africa my wife and i had a beautiful baby Girl. My wife is still back home in Warner Robins. She has taken care of the home front and done quite well at it. It has been hard on her though, She is new to the states (&lt;1yr) and the bit of seclusion and being stuck at home with our baby has kinda worn her out. 

I am looking to try and surprise her and brighten her day a bit in different way.  If anyone would be willing to help out We Both would greatly appreciate it. 

IN Summary: We live in Warner Robins Georgia, Wifey is kinda bummed w/ me being gone and i am trying a different route of brightening her day. 

PS: I do have a verification code, (not sure how it works)
