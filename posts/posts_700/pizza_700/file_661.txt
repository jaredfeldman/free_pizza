I know Christmas eve is tomorrow, but I figured if I posted now this might be seen. Here's the deal, I am a mom of 2 little ones (4 and 1). I will be doing all the Santa duty tomorrow night: wrapping, stockings, putting together toys and trying to make it look like someone visited lol. My husband has to work so this will be the first year I am going solo. (Ironically he works at Pizza Hut lol...unfortunately they dont allow employees free pizza). Anyways, it would make my night much easier to have a pizza delivered. Figured I would ask :)We have a Dominoes, Papa Johns, and Pizza Hut locally.  Thanks for reading even if I dont get my pizza.Happy Holidays!
