I hate having to ask for help like this, but this is really my last option.  I recently had to take my dog to the vet to have a growth on her leg checked.  The exam was $50, the biopsy was $50.  Then the battery in my car went out.  Jumping it worked for awhile, but then a few days ago it stopped holding any charge.  New battery was another $100.

For the past 3 days, my husband and I have been subsisting on pasta.  Yesterday we ran out of pasta sauce, so I can still eat it, but it's so bland and I'm getting tired of it.  Plus, I still breastfeed my son, otherwise I would deal with the blandness, but when my diet tanks, my supply tanks.

(We are in Indianapolis)

Thanks for reading, let me know if I need to give any more information.
