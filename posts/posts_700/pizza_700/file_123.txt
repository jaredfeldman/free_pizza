I guess I could just eat the cereal, but that's all I've eaten for days. It's pretty nauseating. I've actually been really down lately because I literally haven't hung out with people in ages. That aside, I don't have a job anymore, and my food supply has gone low. If someone could just buy a pizza for me today, I would honestly appreciate it and spread it out as long as possible. Hopefully things will pick up around late July/August as everyone goes back to school
