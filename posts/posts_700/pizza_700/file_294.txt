I have been producing for over two years now with Ableton Live.  Some of my previous works can be heard here: www.soundcloud.com/djlactose

Just let me know what kind of music you'd like me to make for you in exchange.  I'm open to doing remixes as well.  

I'm going to college in Colorado.  Let me know!
