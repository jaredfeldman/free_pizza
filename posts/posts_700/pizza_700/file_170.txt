My rent check, student loan payment, &amp; car payment all went through on the same day. Now I'm left with a -$103 account balance and the only thing to eat in my house is apples.

If anyone could be so kind as to pizza me, I would be much obliged. I will have access to funds come Monday, so I'll be able to survive until my paycheck on Friday.

Also, I promise I will pay it forward. When I get paid on Friday, I solomly swear that the first thing I'll do is pizza someone else in need.

Thank you!

**[edit] I've already been pizza'd by the gracious FrankReynolds. Just wanted to update this post, as my "got pizza'd" tag has yet to be applied.**
