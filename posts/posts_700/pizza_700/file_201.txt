I work with FIrst Graders at an after school program- this week I would like to give them a little thanksgiving party, I just don't have the funds to do anything substantial food-wise.
 Anyhow, I would love to teach the kids about random acts of pizza and give them something to really be grateful for. I am happy to share a verification code.
