Hey,

Just a simple request for a girl going through some tough times. My elderly dog is being put to sleep tomorrow and there is nothing in the fridge tonight, and I'm already broke as it is.

I'm in MN, and I'm willing to provide any other information via PM, including verification if that is necessary. Pizza Hut or Papa Johns would be amazing for tonight, definitely would love something to go right for once, even something simple like this. 

You guys are already so wonderful, I will return the favor to another redditor once my bank account isn't hurting so bad.
