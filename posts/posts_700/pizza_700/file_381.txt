My bank account is completely empty (http://i.imgur.com/Sl7GO.jpg), and I'm eating my last can of pork and beans right now. Financial aid doesn't come in for another month, and I could really use something delicious for dinner tonight.

I mean, I have other foodstuffs, I'd just rather I didn't have to eat rice pilaf again.
