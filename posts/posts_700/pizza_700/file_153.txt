Long story short, got laid off, having to move back in with my parents this weekend (shitty situation, but at least they have food in the house). Only been eating ~4-5 meals a week lately, but having finished my last pack of saltine crackers, I'm clean out of food in my apartment. My paltry funds in my bank account have to go towards gas. A good large pizza could last me until I'm back at my parent's place with some food in 4 days. Figured I'd try this as a last resort. Thanks for reading.
