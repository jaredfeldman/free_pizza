So I work at a small, single-owned restaurant, and with the recent heat my hours have been drastically cut. This is my 3rd day off in a row, and my last 2 shifts I was kicked out early because business was slow. Shorter shifts mean less tips. I live on those tips between paydays. My tips have run out, and I made my last ramen noodle last night. I'm searching for a new job because I can't live like this. If this doesn't work, my neighbor will give me some cans and bottles to return so I can buy more ramen noodles. But what would you rather eat, ramen or pizza?
