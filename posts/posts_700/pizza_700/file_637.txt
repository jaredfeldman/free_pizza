I don't even know if this is allowed, because I technically don't want pizza. I do want chocolate lava cake from dominos.


I was due with my husband and I's daughter last Friday. The same day, I had to take my husband to the airport for a week of training. We tried so hard to get out of it, but that's the life in the military.

I honestly could get up and bake some cookies or something, but I am trying to stay in a reclined position. I'm trying to get my contractions to slow down until my husband gets home tomorrow night.
