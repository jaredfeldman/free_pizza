My foot is swollen and I really should stay in bed, unfortunately I'm getting hungry and shouldn't really stand around the kitchen and cook. Being a college student, I'm also tight on money - so a random pizza would be awesome. :) 
I'm not sure what I can give in return, but when I do get around to getting paid, I'd be more than happy to continue on the random acts of pizza.
