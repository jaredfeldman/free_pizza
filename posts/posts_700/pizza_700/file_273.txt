Me, my girlfriend and our 4 month old son just moved into our house a few weeks ago. With moving expenses and bill deposits we are so broke that we can't buy food for this week. I'm not a big guy, 6'1 170lbs, but I eat like a horse and this week I have only ate one PBJ sandwich a day and my girlfriend has only had one thing of noodles per day if that. My son stays well fed, we make sure of that. So I'm only asking for a pizza today, so that maybe we can fill our stomachs for the next few days. In a few weeks when our situation gets better, I will pass on the kindness.
