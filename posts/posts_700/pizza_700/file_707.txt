hello:) I never knew about this place! you guys seem awesome. Well I just had a baby almost 2 months ago. Also my car just broke down. We don't really ever leave the house, and she has been not feeling well the past few days. So I'm kind of insane from no sleep/ constant crying. ~[`_Â°]~ ... I'm not starving, we have some plain rice and spinach, but a pizza souneded amazing and money is very tight until I start work again. Even if no one responds, thanks for being here and helping the people that really need it!!
