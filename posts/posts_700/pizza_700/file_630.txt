Today is my birthday, and I'm hungry. I'm a non-trad college student and a single mom. My daughter is at her dad's at the moment. 
I'm flat broke. I spent the very last of my money on food, but ramen and fish sticks aren't sounding very appetizing at the moment.
I have a code for 20% off at Papa Johns, btw.
