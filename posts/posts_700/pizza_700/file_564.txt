Just your average broke college student looking for some pizza lovin'. I only have 5 weeks before school is over but I'm not doing so hot financially. Hopefully I'll get to work two jobs over the summer. I vow to pay it forward if I do receive some pizza.

I'm currently working on mock-ups for a project. (design student)
