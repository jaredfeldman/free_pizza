Hello!

I'm Riley and I'm requesting pizza for my family.  It'd sure be swell if someone could help us out. We aren't totally starving, but it sure would be a treat. I'm a senior in high school and I work part-time at a grocer. I have 3 little brothers. Conner is 14 and the twins, Ryan and Brando,n are 10. I don't know when my mom was diagnosed with MS, but she worked every day until recently. My dad is a carpenter, but was laid off and has been doing wallpaper for a year now.

I'm going to college next year (don't know where yet) so I can get a good job and take care of my family. They deserve it. I pitch it where I can, but most of my money is going to car insurance right now. 

We're managing over here, but it'd be so great if someone could help get us even just a pizza. My parents do a lot for me and helping them with one meal would make a big difference.

Thank you for taking this time to read this.

P.S. No I'm not cutting school; I'm on my friends computer during study.

I'M REALLY SORRY IF I REPLIED TO EVERYONE A BUNCH OF TIMES. MY COMPUTER IS KINDA OLD AND SLOW AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED
