I'll be honest, there are other people here who probably deserve a pizza more than I do, but at the moment, a pizza sounds really good.
As background, I'm a college student living in Hesperia, CA (AKA: One of the most boring regions of California), who is currently composing a sonnet for his Creative Writing class. I've been craving pizza for the past few days, but I haven't been able to buy any because of the financial aid office holding out on student grants/loans. A recent switch to a college debit card system has pretty much put a lot of people's money in limbo for the time being. This has been annoying, to say the least, since I have books to buy, a gas tank to fill, and an oil leak to fix as well.

Right now, I would only have my gratitude to offer as thanks. Anything would be appreciated.
