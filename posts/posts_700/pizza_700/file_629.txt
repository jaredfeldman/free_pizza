My fiance and I are both starting our second year of college, and we got an apartment this year.  Long story short, she's from out of state, so her tuition and class fee's were doubled, and it ate up most of our money.  Add in having to pay out of our pocket to clean our apartment we JUST moved into to make it anywhere near livable, and I'm stuck with $0.57 in my name until my paycheck hits the 21st. 

So... If you want to cheer two broke college students on a ramen-diet up, it'd be much appreciated!
