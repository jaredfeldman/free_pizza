I've been unemployed but working odd jobs. I worked a job yesterday which I thought paid up front - it did not. Now I'm sitting at home dreaming of pizza (literally, I took a nap and dreamt there was pizza in my fridge, but woke up to nothing but leftover pasta). Will pay forward when I get a chance!
