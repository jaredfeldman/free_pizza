Posted this yesterday, no luck. Just wondering if anyone out there might have a pizza to spare for someone who is out of luck temporarily to enjoy a pizza!

I'm from Houston, TX.

I've been lurking here for several months, and for some reason this was the first place that popped in mind since I got home.

Me and my Sister were in a car wreck last Thursday. We got T-boned in a parking lot by someone who apparently thought talking on their cell phone was more important than watching the road or applying the breaks... Fortunately it was just her and I in the car and they hit the back passenger door, because had they of hit just a foot or two up, I don't think we both would have survived.
We were both taken to the hospital in an ambulance, and my wallet was left in our total'd car which was towed. Hopefully it wasn't stolen or anything and it's still where I left it in the car.

Anyway I don't want to ramble, but to sum it up, my Sister and I would be very grateful to anyone willing to help someone out in a tough spot with some pizza. When things get settled out here and I get back on my feet(literally!) then definitely plan on returning the favor to someone who's in a bind and could use the help.

Thank you so much!
