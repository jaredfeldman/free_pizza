I'm not uber poor, I don't have a story to share except I'm feeling lazy as hell today.  Would love something I don't have to cook and can't remember the last time we had pizza that wasn't frozen. Any offers appreciated but if you want to give to someone else no hard feelings.

EDIT: Forgot to add, I'm in California.
