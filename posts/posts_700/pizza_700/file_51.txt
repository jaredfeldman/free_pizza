I've known about this lovely subreddit for a while, but always decided against actually posting a request because there are people in so much worse situations than I. But, at this point the new tab isn't quite so dire, sooo....

I don't want to whine or drag on. Basically, I've been jobless for a few months now. My sister is my roommate; I'm basically crashing here, but have to be out next month, as she's apparently moving in with her boyfriend after that. No, I don't feel good about being a jobless layabout. I've been job hunting hard but nothing's been working out, and I can only really get around on foot.

Anyway, so the only food I've had around here is potatoes. Which wouldn't be so bad, but there's really nothing to put on them (no butter for baked ones, no ketchup for fries, no oil or vinegar for cooking them with.) It's better than no food, but the combination of dry potatoes and tap water is crazy bland. The aforementioned sister spends most of her time with her boyfriend; my parents dropped off the bag of potatoes a couple of weeks ago. I don't wanna complain or anything, it's good to have a place to stay (for now) and sustenance,  but... a pizza, of any kind or any place, would be so so rad. Haven't pizza since July (my birthday.)

 I will of course pizza it forward immediately when I'm in a position to do so, this subreddit is such a wonderful thing and needs all the offerers it can get to keep it running.

Hope I'm doing this right! Thanks!
