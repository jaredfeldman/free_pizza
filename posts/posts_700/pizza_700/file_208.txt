Hey guys, I just got back from the vet after my kitten had an accident, poor guy broke his paw. I don't earn much and scrap by every week with my food budget and the veterinarian bill really set me back this week. If someone here could help me out it would really put my mind at ease. Thanks for reading, here's a pic of the little [guy](http://imgur.com/nzE6x)
