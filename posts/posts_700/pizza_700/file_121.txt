I have ~20 bucks on me since I sent the rent check off yesterday, and I hate asking my parents for cash when I get paid from my job on the 15th. I'm at work now (on campus job) and don't really want to eat Pop Tarts for dinner. There's a Dominos next to campus that always has cheap student specials, but I want to try and make my 20 dollars last as long as possible simply because I don't want to ask for bailout from my parents (trying to actually be an adult and make a living for myself.)

It's okay if you guys want to give to someone more needy! I just kinda thought I'd try and see if this struck with anyone familiar with the situation! Best of luck to everyone out there!
