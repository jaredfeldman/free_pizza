Ok, ready for the sob story? Got kicked out of an apartment and screwed out of my security deposit because the landlord's secretary made a mistake, my car broke down and then had two windows smashed, got robbed for a $700 financial aid check from school (gonna take six months to get it back now), and now the guy I did some painting for has just disappeared without paying me. So yeah, I'm broke and starving..staying at a friend's place in exchange for taking care of their pets. I've been living on my own since I was a teenager and I've never been in such a bad spot like this - made a throwaway because I'm honestly ashamed at the state my life is in right now.

The good news is that I just got hired somewhere, so in a few weeks when I get paid I'll pay it forward to someone else who's down on their luck. thanks in advance.
