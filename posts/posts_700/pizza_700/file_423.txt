No real sob story here. Just your typical broke-after-paying-rent college student at UNT. Ramen and sandwiches until Thursday seems fairly unappetizing so I was hoping to get a good meal to last through the weekend.

I just discovered this sub and it's awesome. Definitely excited to be able to pay it forward after the money rolls back in...
