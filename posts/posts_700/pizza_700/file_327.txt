Yesterday I got laid off with a job I've been working for over a year now. My boyfriend hasn't been working for the past two months since he also got laid off working construction. I have no idea what we are going to do now..rent is due on the 5th at the latest and the next check I get wont be until the 12th. Pretty much feeling shitty about everything right now, trying to figure out what I can do to get money quickly. Plus my ph. is gonna be outta mins, my insurance, and internet bill is due...oh ya &gt;.&lt; ...could really use a random act of pizza.
