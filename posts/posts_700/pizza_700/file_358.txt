Hey there everyone. I hate asking for handouts but things are a little tight right now after traveling for the holidays and I had barely enough to cover my rent this month. All I have in the kitchen is some ramen and nasty chicken rice stuff. If anyone would be so kind as to get me some pizza tonight I'll repay them once I get paid, or if you'd prefer I'll buy someone else here some pizza.
