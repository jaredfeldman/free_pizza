I've been out of work for a couple months now, dealing with my bi-polar disorder/depression. Reoccurring hospital visits caused me to give up my job and move back home and "start from scratch." I could use a lift. The money that I DID have saved has gone to help out around the house and i've not really been left with much else. I'm really not one to ask for handouts, but as far as food goes lately it's been slim pickens and a pizza sounds good :) Thanks for reading and if you can help, thanks, and if not, thats okay too.
