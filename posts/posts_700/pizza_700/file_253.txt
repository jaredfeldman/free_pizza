I'm using my real account, and it shames me that it's come to this.  
  
Last Friday I had to do something no one ever wants to do, I had to phone my mom and dad to ask for money. I have not lost my job, but my car's exhaust broke. For those familiar with cars, the clamp where the catalytic converter and exhaust meet up rusted through, and the rust had damaged the pipes and cat under the car. The shop's bill came to $320 and some change, to replace the rusted pipes/cat and weld up the connections.  
  
Let me say that I'm not in a dire situation, my parents were able to lend me enough to cover my overdraft fee and most of my rent, but I've nothing left for food. I have enough frozen burritos to survive, but a warm pizza would be amazing.  
  
Back to the escapism of videogames for the time being.
