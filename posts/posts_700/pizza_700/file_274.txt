I could really use something simple. I just finished a package of instant mashed potatoes and have a pack of top ramen. My sister plans to send money on Tuesday, I just don't think I can continue feeling the way I am until then. I can make a large pizza last me through Monday. 

You can guarantee I will pay it forward to someone as needy as myself when I get receive my first paycheck from my new job I started.

A huge thanks, Reddit.
