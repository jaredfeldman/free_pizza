I got laid off from my job on December 12th unexpectedly, and have been struggling to get back on my feet ever since. Help with food for a night or two would be really appreciated for me and my SO since I couldnt spoil her like I wanted for christmas.

If nobody can help, I hope everyone has a wonderful day and good luck on all those New Years Resolutions!

Happy Belated New Years
