I have $0.09 in my bank account and I don't think I can bear to eat anymore oatmeal.  I've been having it for most of my meals for the past 3 days. Thankfully I work in a dining hall and have access to one majorly square meal most days, but man, in between is brutal!

I'm totally down to pay forward the ROAP after tonight, when I get paid.

And just a notice: I'm not available from 7-10 p.m. (EST) tonight.  Hopefully a Pizza Baron comes before then, since I'm hungry now.  But if not, well, there's always more oatmeal.
