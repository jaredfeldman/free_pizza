Hey guys! I've been craving pizza lately, and have enough money to buy for myself but I figured in the spirit of RAOP, I need to give back. So here's the idea I'd like to pitch:

I'm willing to send cookies (of your choice!! although I've been keen on making some bacon choco chip ones lately) to the sender of my pizza, and another random person (or maybe 2. or 3. probably from [/r/RandomActs Of Cookies](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfCookies/)). I've also got some ideas on how to send cupcakes that I'd like to try as well. I'm a pretty damn good baker so I hope this attempt of "paying it forward" is sufficient. 
I should also mention I'm in B.C., but willing to ship anywhere!
