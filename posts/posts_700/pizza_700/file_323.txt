I work as a sub-contractor and my boss decided to leave town when he owed me money for this week's work. I had been counting on that money because my kids are here until Tuesdy night. My 7 yo daughter even mentioned how I never have anything good to eat here (it was completely innocent, but still hits home). Glad to buy someone a pizza Tuesday night... In need right now though. Anyone?
