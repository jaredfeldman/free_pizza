Hey ROAP, I've been lurking here for quite a while and finally have decided to ask for some help. I am currently about 40 dollars in the hole in my bank account (miscalculation of bills) and hardly any food in the house. I could sure use a fresh hot pizza tonight! I can pay it ~~back~~ forward when I get paid. Would make going to work tomorrow so much easier. Reddit is the best!

I can PM details and proof if you want. Thanks RAOP!
