(Forgot to mention that I live in Central TX) 

Long shot, but here goes.

I'm unemployed and going through a divorce. Aside from cheating on me she spent all my money and what little I had left went straight to the divorce. I'm down to my last $35.00-----period. This is AFTER selling everything I have that I don't still owe money on. I literally own nothing else but clothes, computer, car, and a dryer. My friends and family have already helped far too much and I'd hate to ask for more favors. I'm ALL out of groceries and won't begin to collect unemployment for another week or two. I didn't eat at all yesterday. 

I was wondering if there was someone out there who would be kind enough to feed me today. I don't care what size or whats on it, I just need something to eat.
