Pizza could mean a meal for my sister her family

My sister recently has had a string of bad happenings, Both of our grandmothers just died and her Car broke down on the way to the funerals (~500mi)... Its been very tough and we recently went over her financial standing and she averages -120 a month (more if you include her hospital bill that she dosn't pay)-- but Money aside what she needs most is food especially for her daughter(12) and step daughter(17). Thats what she really cares about..

She recently gained full custody of her daughter, the father sat in jail for the first 9 years of his daughter's life.. then upon regaining his freedom sought to take her away to montana, over 2,000 miles away. An ex-con with a new lawyer girlfriend and a seedy past of child abuse with his other offspring.. luckily she won that- but with that came a nice sized loan for her own lawyer

She's been denied by assistance and by the local food bank- she make JUST over the line for too much

Canned Goods, Cereal, Lunch items for school or anything else

I, her younger sister, am a designer (the starving artist) I gave her what i could of my savings to keep her in her apartment, but now i'm reaching out to the Web- She has pizza hut and papa johns by her home or  I can trade work for pizza/favors

Thank you for your time

TLDR: Sister is desperately behind and needs help, especially with food for her 2 daughters
