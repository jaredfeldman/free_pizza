I've spent the last three days fixing my car, and in the process had to spend all of my money in parts and it's still not fixed yet :(  I've had nothing but bread (no peanut butter or jelly :() the last two days (it was time to go grocery shopping right before car broke down.) I have tried everything to get borrow money from friends, but being college students they couldn't do much.  If someone could send me a pizza that would be awesome, I'd so appreciate it, it'd last last me three days too! I'll pay it forward Friday!
