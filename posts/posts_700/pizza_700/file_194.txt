I've never done this and I should probably use a throwaway, but whatever. I've been unemployed, again, for a few weeks now and my unemployment checks are less than half of what I was making when I was working. I've applied to over twenty jobs in the past month and only one has even gotten back to me to say that they had found someone better suited. All of my bills and rent are/were late, I can barely afford enough food, and, to top it off, I can't even go snowboarding....which is truly the only thing that keeps me sane in the winter. All of my friends are snowboarders and most of them are out riding tonight. I'm not saying a pizza would cure the shit that's going through my head, but I could definitely use one to help restore some optimism in my life.
EDIT: I know I'm not in the worst of shape with where I'm at, but I do battle with some very strong depression from time to time and right now is one of those times. Also, I'd always rather give than receive and bringing myself to ask for help is one of the hardest things for me to do.
