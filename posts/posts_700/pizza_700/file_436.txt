So here's the deal:  I didn't know my college had shortened dinner hours on Sunday (only been here a week!) and was so busy catching up on work for my Comp Sci class that I missed eating.  Every place to eat on campus is closed early and I'm on a campus just far enough from town to make walking for food slightly dangerous.  I'm going to be up late programming and I'm starting to get really, really hungry...  

In exchange I can offer an Android app in which you draw doodles on a cat face. [Screenshot](http://imgur.com/zuURi)

I'm in MA, by the way :)
