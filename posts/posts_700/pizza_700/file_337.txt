After a particularly ill-timed lay-off, I've finally found a new job! Not only that, but it looks like the lay-off might have been a blessing in disguise, because this job seems amazing!

Unfortunately, I don't get paid for a while. While I have some left-overs I could eat, I'd love to be able to celebrate with a delicious pizza! (And of course, the first new paycheck will have me celebrating again by paying the pizza-giving forward!)

Thanks, everyone!
