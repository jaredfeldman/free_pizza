My fiancé and I bought this beautiful '66 Ford F-350, knowing that we'd have to fix it up a bit....a bit turned into rebuilding the entire engine. We thought we could do it cheap, as my fiancé's dad used to own a garage where he put in many an hour. I even got out there and greasy to help! I learned a lot, but we've spent around $2,000, plus buying the truck (we were walking everywhere, luckily we live in a small town). So to wrap up this entirely too long post, we're broke and hungry, so if someone is willing to help us out, that'd be fantastic!
