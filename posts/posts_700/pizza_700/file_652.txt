Hey ya, I am coming here to ask for a pizza if any one is feeling kind enough!  I'm pretty hungry and I have no buying power.  I am a very poor college student whos had it pretty rough in the past year and...  Well, I'd enjoy a pizza very much.  

Thanks guys and gals, I really appreciate it and I try to pay it forward each day by just being a kind person each day in real life.  :)
