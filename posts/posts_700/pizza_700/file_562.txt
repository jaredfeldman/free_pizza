Southeast Michigander here. We're a couple living together in a small home on have been on a single income for nearly four months now. My S/O just got a new job but there wont be a paycheck for a couple of weeks. I've been floating us by but we're both college students too so it's not like we had any sort of saving to speak of :p. 

Anyway, we were hoping for a ROAP with an absolute promise to pay it forward times two this upcoming Friday. We've nothing but soup and green beans in the pantry! (Although green beans are damned delish aren't they? Just not very filling. :D)

Thanks for hearing me out &lt;3
