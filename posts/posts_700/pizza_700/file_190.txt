I'm a 22 year old student out of Topeka, KS, majoring in accounting and finance. I am currently on the hunt for a 2nd job that'll pay for tuition, books, and the other expenses life presents me. As my current job barely covers rent and utilities, food has kinda taken a back seat for me. I know I'm new on here, but I have been a long time member on other web sites like Slickdeals.net, which showed me how to save money on groceries thru Amazon.

I am hitting up a temp agency today to see if I can find an immediate solution to my money quandaries. If I am successful in supplementing my income, I will gladly return to do my part in keeping the wheel of Pizza graciousness spinning. My birthday is coming up on the 14th of July, and I have always felt more comfortable with giving than receiving on my special day. Like a hobbit.

It would be such a blessing to not have to worry about where my next couple meals are coming from.
