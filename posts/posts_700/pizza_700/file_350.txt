Hey Raop,

I recently got a job as a Standardized Patient, yay. But its been about a month since my last job as a camp counselor and funds are low and the tummy is growling.

I won't lie, I'm not out of food, I could go and eat some beans and rice again for the 5th night in a row but I kinda want to mix it up. 

Someone wanna help me out?
