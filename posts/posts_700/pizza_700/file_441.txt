Hey guys :) Just found this website...what a miracle. Basically, me and my sister are students and are trying our hardest not to ask our parents for money all summer like we usually do. We have no money until Sunday where we are doing a paid photo-shoot but right now, we are SO hungry.

If we got pizza it would save us as we get so irritable when we're hungry (we all know the feeling)

Please help us!!! We will definitely repay the favour on Sunday! (pizza all round yayay!)
