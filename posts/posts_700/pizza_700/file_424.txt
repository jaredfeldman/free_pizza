SO, I lost my job about a month ago, waiting/hoping on unemployment insurance, utilities are slowly being turned off (I currently have no hot water, BBRRRRRRRR), i'm sick of asking friends for money and my mom has helped me more than she is able to.

My dog Odie is also out of food now, today I fed him some leftover eggs and hashbrowns with gravy, he will also be enjoying the pizza and I will post pictures of this.

My request is for www.screaminmimispizza.com specifically, because it's only a couple dollars more than a regular chain pizza and it will feed me for 2-3 days. My favorite is a pizza w/ eggplant or the bbq chicken pizza w/ ricotta.

Thanks for reading,
Drew
