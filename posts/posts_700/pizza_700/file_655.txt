Hey everyone, my name is Nick, I'm 23, had to drop out of college a year ago, and I'm currently living in a van in front of my friend's house. I lost my job and have been looking for a new one for about a month and a half now, so far, to no avail. I'm not asking for a pizza just for me to enjoy, but also for my friend who is helping me out a ton until I get back on my feet. I'm not starving and I have a safe place to sleep, thanks to his generosity. It's been quite a humbling and learning experience, and I'd like to be able to give him something back in return; I feel like pizza would be a great way to do that. I can't think of anything to do or give in exchange (but if you can, let me know), other than a poem written about whatever you want and the promise to pay it forward when things get better for me. Thanks for your time!
