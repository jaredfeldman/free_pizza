Alright...so, I'll try to keep it brief, not sure if I'm doing this right...I'm a grad student studying school psychology, I work as a fitness coach training the elderly to stay limber and healthy, I mentor, and I am currently working as a AmeriCorps member with United Way going out and meeting with parents and community members discussing how to get them more involved in their school.  On the weekends, I volunteer at an organic CSA farm and I'm getting getting ready to get married next summer.  

Man, long story short reddit, I never eat out, but I just finished giving this brainiac an IQ test that took 3 hours and I would REALLY love to have some pizza...I'm broke (make less than minimum wage when my 2 "jobs" are averaged out) otherwise I'd just buy it myself.  

I have beer, but no pizza.  I'm not gonna go hungry but...I've been up since 4:00 a.m. and I really need a pizza.  If I get a pizza I'll plant something for you at the farm :)

Thanks for your consideration!
