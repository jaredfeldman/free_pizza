I'm a student who is currently looking for work.  My husband works long hours, but (after a series of unfortunate and close-together events) we are completely BROKE.  In all honestly, it's inspired the kind of creative cooking that is fun every once in a while.  Alas, we just ate our last bag of dry beans and our bank account is over-drafted due to unavoidable bills (will send a screen shot of bank account, if desired).  I'd like to say that we could pay you back soon, but until I find a job that's a promise I can't commit to.  I do, however, plan on getting more involved in this community once we're back on our feet.  I love reading about the kindness of strangers and would love to participate soon!  I'm planning on going to our local food bank tomorrow if this doesn't produce any fruit...I hate to do that because there is always someone in more need than I am, but when you're on your last packet of ramen, things get desperate!  Anyways, thanks for reading and happy reddit-ing!
