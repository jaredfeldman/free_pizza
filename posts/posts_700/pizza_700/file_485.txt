Posting from my phone (contract expires next Wednesday) as we have no wifi. Girlfriend and I met on the Internet, have been in a long-distance relationship (with monthly visits) for ten months. Just moved into a new apartment with her last week. I'm the happiest I've been in a long time, but we are pretty tight on money. I'm job-hunting, she works at a minimum wage fast food restaurant (she brings food back from her job, which is how we eat right now). A pizza or two would be nice if anyone has a few extra bucks lying around. We can handle the delivery guy's tip. Thanks.
