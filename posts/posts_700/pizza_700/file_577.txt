I know a hard drive sounds like a luxury but I do online classes and there's no way I would have been able to go two weeks without a new one and rent is due tomorrow. I brought all my cash together and have just enough to pay it and my water bill. I know it sounds kind of snooty, but I can't/won't eat ramen. I grew up poor and it was dbreakfast/lunch/and dinner for 5 days out of the week. It turns my stomach now. I understand that I've been pizza'd before but that was over a year ago and I have paid it forward. I would appreciate any help and will be able to return the favor either to you or a person of your choosing, or just a random hungry person. Thanks :)

EDIT: I have posted and received a pizza but at some point in my Reddit career, I deleted all mention of my ex, therefore, I have received before, but I have paid it forward. I deleted it without thinking I would use this subreddit again.
