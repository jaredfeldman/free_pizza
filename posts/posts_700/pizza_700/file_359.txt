I am so hungry, me and my roommate have had only saltine crackers to eat for like the last 2 days, we spend all our money on our bills :(  the groceries are the last thing to stock for the sake of everyone always coming to our place to eat our food. Everything has been really short lately and it just sucks! , If you could help out in any way that would be amazing. It would be very filling and a great surprise for my roommate...I would pay it forward in due time to someone else in need.

thank you, &lt;3
