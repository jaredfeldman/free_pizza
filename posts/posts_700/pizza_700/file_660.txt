Hi there, well I am kinda hesitant about asking but I think the stomach is winning the war over pride. Long story short, had a roommate bail on me, owes me a bunch of monies. Financial aid for summer didn't go so far when my expenses for roof/power/water almost doubled. Hey but it's been great for aesthetics I've lost about 15 pounds since May. Its also been great for teaching me how to be more frugal, and learned to accept charity ( thank you whatever is above for food pantrys). I am moving soon, back home for the fall but I am down to $60 which has to last two weeks, and half of which will have to go to gas. I am in Las Cruces, NM. . . Have a code and such and a major hankering for some hot delicious pizza. Extra Karma bonus Points if you get them to draw a Pony on the box, preferably Pinkie Pie. . .
