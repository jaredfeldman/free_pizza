Long story short;

 Stuff happened.  I'm all tapped out, and have no family or friends to ask for help.  Local pantry isn't until first week of June and by then, I'll be back in the way positive again.

Come Friday, I'll have 3 paychecks.  Figure the luck on that.



Please!  Having nothing to eat/drink but water and it sucks.
