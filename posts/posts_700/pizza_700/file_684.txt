I'm in a state of disbelief and shock. I don't have the energy to cook. Pizza would be a nice comfort right now, considering it's the next best thing to hugs.

I'm in Massachusetts. Dominos gift card is best. I'll draw a picture of anything you want in return, if you'd like, even though I'm not that good.
