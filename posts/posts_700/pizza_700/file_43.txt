Okay, so I'm going to try to keep this short, and stay with me because it really is a series of slightly unrelated events that landed me in my situation. Sometime on Sunday, my Xbox Live account was stolen, and almost $140 dollars worth of Xbox Live points were charged to my debit card. I called Xbox and got help getting a claim filed as soon as I realized. THEY said it would take 25 days, and I should contact my bank if I want a speedier return of my precious monies. They also said my Xbox live account would remain suspended until their investigation was complete.

Today after work, I did so, getting another fraud case opened by my bank. The banker said, or so I thought, that my card would be closed **in** 5-7 days. Mission accomplished, I head to the grocery story to buy something for dinner.   

I had my food items rounded up and checked out, when BAM! My card was declined. Okay... maybe they went ahead and turned it off for purchases. No worries, my bank is across the street, and while they may be closed, they have an ATM.  

Maybe you see where this is going...  

OM NOM NOM went the ATM, gobbling my debit card and spitting out a mere slip of paper in its stead- in essence it said "this is **our** card now, criminal."  

So that's it. No entertainment (by way of online video games), no food (by way of the cancelled card), and not even a way to get money (by way of the gluttonous automatic teller machine) until sometime tomorrow when I can physically walk into my bank and withdraw the cash from their electronic grasp.
