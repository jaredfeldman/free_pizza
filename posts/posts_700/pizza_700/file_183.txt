Hey everyone, I graduated early on Monday but unfortunately about 3 hours before I was going to celebrate, my best friend called me saying her grandfather died and I've spent the last few days since then comforting her, making sure she doesn't focus on it, etc. This has lead to a lack of celebration and all I really want for graduating is a pizza. So if someone wants to help me celebrate, I'd really appreciate it.
