I've got a movie date tomorrow night (Wednesday 2/1) and he's ordering the movie I want to see via onDemand. I'd like to order us a big ol' pizza to snack on after a long day of class/work/meetings *but* I only have $4 in my account.

**I get paid on Friday and will offer 2 separate pizzas asap to pay it forward!**

I'm in the US and there's a Domino's only a block from his place. Any offers would be immensely appreciated and many good vibes and thanks will be sent!!

[edit] I also have great coupons for my area!! So I'd only need a small donation :)
