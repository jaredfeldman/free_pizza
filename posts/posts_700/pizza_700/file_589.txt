I'm supporting myself okay, and got a part-time job recently, but I haven't been getting enough hours so my food budget has been grim (think basic chicken + rice, pasta, sandwiches). I won't get my financial aid until next month, and most of this summer I've spent working/trying to make rent. 

Could definitely use a pick me-up pizza tonight if someone is willing to help. 

Edit: this is my first post on this subreddit, so please correct me if I need to add any info/etc.
