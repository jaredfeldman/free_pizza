Hi RAoP! 
I live in Miami and have been short on money. Chicken's pretty much the only thing our family's had since we moved down in August. (Father says it's the cheaper meat and can be spread out over days). Heh and I've been craving pizza recently (well, any other type of meat really) and was wondering if anyone could get me out of this chicken routine heh.

I don't really know what to provide you guys, but I here's a picture of my cow cat putting his paw on my hand :)
