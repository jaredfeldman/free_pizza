Hello fellow humans, another sad story is the last thing i want to put on here or read. Me and my daughter samantha are hungry, we just moved out of state and got into a new aptmartment. We have no food or money until tomorow morning when i can cash my check. i would be willing to work for the pizza if there is anything i can do online. Im not rich but will pay it forward if there is anyone willing to help. Thank you :) Sally May
