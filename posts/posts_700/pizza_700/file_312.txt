For quite a while now, I have been nonstop hard at work on an interactive multimedia project called [[6x]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmCqEP2v_Wo) - a double-disc immersive experience with hours of puzzles, "flash films", trip-tools, hallucinogenic visuals, and TONS of hidden features.  Caught between a surreal nightmare and warped mindtrip, this DVD package presents an immersive journey through hypnagogic insomnia in which the viewer is in full control.  Composed from hundreds of sources of bygone media - deconstructed, distorted, glitched and reassimilated into a mind-bending menagerie of disturbing and psychedelic ventures into the user's psyche.  Think of it like a interactive-video-game/experimental-art-film double-DVD set, with a heavy emphasis on the experimental and interactive.

*Note: Contains disturbing and/or adult material. Intended for mature audiences only.*


The project is currently in the autumn stage of development and production (about 70% complete) and slated for release [here](http://0011011001111000.bandcamp.com/) on August 20th, 2013.  Previews available [here](https://www.youtube.com/0011011001111000) and [here](http://0011011001111000.tumblr.com/), though it's difficult to convey the interactive aspect of the project in pictures and videos.

**So here's the thing:**
I'm broke right now and pretty hungry, but I do have the DVD package to offer in exchange.  The only hitch is - it won't be released until August 20th.  So if any redditors are interested in the DVD or hooking a hungry brother up with some pizza, comment here!

**EDIT: Feel free to ask any questions about the project as well, I understand it's kind of hard to describe.**
