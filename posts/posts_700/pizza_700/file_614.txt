So I work for state mental health agency, I recently hurt my back breaking up a fight between a few of our kids at work and have been out on workers comp. which has delayed my normal pay so I'm a but broke. My neurosurgeon today told me I'll require surgery to fuse two vertebrae together. Now, I've never had any kind of surgery before, so it's a little daunting to think about. I'm very optimistic about the procedure though, and I feel I lucked up with a very good cutter handling my issue. Pizza would make me feel better though, that comfort food thing we all have at times. Can anyone help a partially broken and broke guy out?
