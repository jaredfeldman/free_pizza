We have a week left here in Colorado, before moving back to Indiana to start completely from scratch. Tomorrow my son turns 7 and he's so excited. He hasn't decided what he would like for his "birthday" dinner as it's just him and I, but I know he is leaning towards pizza.

With the cost of the move, and the deposit I had to give. I am scrapped. 

This is not a need, just a birthday wish for some yummy pizza tomorrow to celebrate his birthday! 

Thanks for reading!
