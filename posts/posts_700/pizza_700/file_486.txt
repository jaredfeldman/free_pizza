My autistic nephew had his 15th birthday yesterday. I bought him some Dora The Explorer DVDs for him.

 On my way home from work I stopped by Walmart to grab a frozen pizza but was declined at the register. 

There's a Soul Food fund raiser at work tomorrow where I can eat, and then I get paid on Thursday. However tonight I've got nothing.

I'm requesting just a basic pizza to eat tonight with some slices I can save for breakfast. Since I get paid on Thursday I can totally pay it forward. It would really help me out guys, and I'd really like to return the favor. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. And my nephew loved the DVDs. His sister looks like Dora, so he gets very excited when watching them since he cant live with his 'real' family. He's a former student of my sister who took him in from his parents who couldn't take care of him. Long story, but I don't mind answering any questions about it.
