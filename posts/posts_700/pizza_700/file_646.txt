My fiancee has been sick since last night after she got out of work with a fever, chills, and body aches. I have been working all day, and she has been at home in bed and I want to be able to bring home a hot pizza for us to have for dinner when I get out of work.

She takes care of me endlessly, and I want to be able to do something for her, we just don't have any money right now. I know she has been craving hot pockets all day, but we don't have any so I figure if it is possible, this will really help brighten her day.
