My fianc√©e is very hungry. She has had a really bad day at work. I want to be able to have something for her to be able to come home to that's good to eat, and be able to cheer her up. We're both beyond broke and no food left in our house.  

We won't get paid again for another two weeks. We both work part time and living paycheck to paycheck right now. Trying to get back on track with our bills after I'd been out of work for close to two months. I'm hoping to be getting a second job as soon as I can get the call back to start. Catching up on our bills has left us completely broke. 

I was wanting to try to get us a large pizza. Her favorite is Meat Lovers, but we'd greatly appreciate any kind. We live in Kentucky. As soon as we can get back on our feet, I promise to pay this forward and help someone that is in the same dire straits that we are currently going through.
