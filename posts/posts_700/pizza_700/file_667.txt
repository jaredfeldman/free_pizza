TL;DR - My spouse and I are hurting too bad to walk for groceries and have run out of food.


I am mid 30's, hub is in his 40's. 

We rely on one another to get things as a team, but the last two days, my knee has been "out" and his back has been "out" and our grocery trip relies on us walking a half mile to the local Walmart neighborhood grocery store, filling up backpacks and a large rolling suitcase, and walking home with them. 


We have to do our month's shopping all at once because we are on the stamps and to break it up into smaller trips wouldn't allow the money to stretch.


We have an offer for a ride to the store tomorrow, but we've been eating once a day for a week and ran out of food yesterday.

Please pm me if you can help. Willing to answer any questions.
