I'm broke for another two weeks and so dang hungry for some good eats. I paid my rent today, and got my phone turned back on, and now I've got nada to last me until my next check. Not to mention, I owe some money to the bank due to some ridiculous overdraft fees that I did not intentionally incur. My rent check was cashed by my landlord really late, after I thought he'd already taken it out a while back. I had to ask my roommate to cover the utility bills until I can pay my half later (I'll be sharing the possible pizza with her too, she's an angel). 

I'm steadily working on a film my friends and I are making, which I love, but buying supplies for what I want/need to do along with paying my bills has left me in a bit of a rut. Frankly, I fucked up on my budget. I have an interview for a second job tomorrow, which I'm pretty stoked about. 

Other than that, I love pizza, so naturally Random_Acts_Of_Pizza is freaking awesome. If someone meets my request, I'll pay you back or someone else once I get back on my feet in a few weeks, no problem.
