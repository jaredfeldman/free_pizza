I'm not due to go back to my job until next week. I've been off for hand surgery. I'm broke, my temporary food stamps have run out until the 10th, and my parents can't put $20 into my account until the bank re-opens Tuesday (Monday is a bank holiday). Can someone please help?

Also, this account is a throwaway. I'm embarrassed and I don't want my friends to see. I will be happy to give you my other user name and PM you from that account for proof. Thanks for reading.
