I present a humble situation where one brave soul could prove their honor.  Unfortuantely, I am getting laid off in 2 days, sucks, I know, but thats not the worst of it.  My girlfriend and I went grocery shopping recently, using the very last of our food stamps. During our trip, we put all our groceries in the car (which we use twice a month to go get groceries, can't afford to drive more than that.) Once we got home we realized after a couple hours that the only item we left in the cart, was our pizza.  I called the store and they said that unless someone brought it in and reported it, we wouldn't be able to get our pizza.  Sadly, nobody reported it.  We really really wanted that pizza! So as I did an inadvertant RAoP, I'm hoping that a generous redditer will bestow upon us a delicious pizza pie!  I have verification code! Want to make our night?
