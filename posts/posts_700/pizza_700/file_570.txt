So, as the title says, I'm currently broke. Well, to be more exact, I have $2.07 in my bank account, so I guess I'm not out on my ass quite yet.

My boyfriend and I both are students and work part-time jobs, but unfortunately our jobs were both seasonal and now that the school year's pretty much over, so are our jobs. We're looking for work, but as many of you I'm sure know, that can be tough.

I'd really appreciate any generosity from you great folks. A pizza tonight would be really, really awesome. Thanks so much.
