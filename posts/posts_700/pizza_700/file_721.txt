Thanks if you can help in any way! I was looking at a few of the request threads, and when I saw the pizza it started a craving I guess :) you guys do amazing work!

I get off at 4:30pm EST so I don't know if there's a way to pre-schedule them or something? And I can pick it up as well to save extra costs!
