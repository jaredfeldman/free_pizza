I have been homeless before and never asked for help in such ways.  I am working, but job only pays once a month.  I have been broke for 16 days, was supposed to be payed Friday.  Been all weekend without food.  I can see my money in bank but cannot touch it until tomorrow.  I will re-gift someone else in return or refund money.
