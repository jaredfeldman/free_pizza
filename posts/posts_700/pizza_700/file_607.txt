Us + our two children. A family member who is usually here is in the hospital and the last few days have been hard for everyone. There is really no food to speak of and we won't be able to get anything until the 24th. 

Full disclaimer, someone did get us a couple of pizzas 17 days ago. I feel like I should be honest about this being another request after a somewhat recent one from us. But we are stuck in such a bad situation this month, we called food banks to see if any of them could drop off some food for us (but none will deliver, even if you have no transportation, which we don't) and with $1.51 to our name right now, this is all I could think of. 

Thank you for reading and considering our request. We very much hope to be on the giving end of things someday.
