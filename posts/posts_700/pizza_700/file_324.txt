**First let me say that I will provide any reasonable verification as to the validity of what I am going to say. Just message me. I am very sorry for the pity parade, honestly, however my embarrassment is over weighed by my concerned for my friend and her family. If you have any advice that I can forward to her please private message me. Thank you.**

So here is the situation:
I am requesting pizzafication on behalf of a friend of mine who does not Reddit. She is a young mother, married, and with two children (3 and 1). She recently moved to Glendale, AZ from Florida. She was supposed to be able to stay with an In-Law. That plan fell through due to circumstances outside of her control and she has to vacate her current residence this Friday. She has one other family member in the city that she will be moving in with. She has a job lined up with a call center but doesn't start for 2 months (she has to wait for the next training classes to start). 

**So yes, long term, she will be OK.**

The problem, is that DES hasn't approved her application yet (she has not been in the state long) and she and her husband are skipping eating meals days at a time. Thankfully she is still managing for her children, at the expense of her and her husband eating. I am just looking for a meal to help her get to next week, where I am pretty sure she will be OK (and I will be able to lend further aid at that point if she isn't).
