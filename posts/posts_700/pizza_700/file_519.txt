Today is my wife and my anniversary. While we have had a great day together and have enjoyed it, unfortunately there has been a little something missing. We haven't had a chance to treat ourselves today, (or this week, month, year) due to financial reasons. While we do have the 20 bucks for a pizza, it's literally our last and we can't justify spending it regardless of the day. The usual long list of financial, employment and medical hardships have gotten us where we are but that's not what we're here for. We're here to hopefully CELEBRATE our second wedding anniversary with the help from fellow redditors.

Oh ya, and my wife is 7 months pregnant so you know she's ready for a pizza!
