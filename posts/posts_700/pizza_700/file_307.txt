Hi all -- I've been referred here by my sister in Wisconsin where this was mentioned on her local news. After paying our utility bills and only partial rent this month, my family is down to 8 cents in the bank until the 1st. I go to food pantries in my area when I need to, but they only operate on certain days and will not be available for a few. I can provide any proof and would gladly pay anything back. A little food for me and my kids would help a lot right now.
