So I spent the weekend with a good friend of mine and his room mate. In exchange, I just ordered them a pizza and a couple of 2 liters of Mello Yellow. Being college students, they hadn't had the money to go to a grocery store and their fridge consisted of a carton of eggs and a pitcher of koolaid. I felt like they needed it. Anywho, my problem now is that now that I've bought someone else pizza, I really want some. It's just me so a small one would do fine and I have plenty of drinks in my dorm. I'd be ever grateful. &lt;3
