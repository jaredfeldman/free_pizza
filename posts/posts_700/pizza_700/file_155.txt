I just want to start off by saying how wonderful this community is. I've been looking at some of these posts on here, and how helpful and giving those within the community have been, and it really warms my heart to know there are people like that out there in the world.

I'm wondering if there a chance someone would be willing to help me out as well. I'm a stay at home mom, raising my three little ones, Jason (6) and Michelle and Christina (both 3 1/2), while my husband works. Sadly, he lost his job about a year ago, and with this economy, he has only been able to pick up jobs here and there, and we're getting towards the end of our savings.

I would love to be able to sit down with a nice pizza dinner one night, and just be able to relax and enjoy the company of one another, that is, before the little ones start crying again. Pizza used to be a luxury purchase for us before, now it is almost impossible.

Anyone with a soft spot in their heart able to help out?

Thanks
