My bday is next tuesday and I was hoping one of you guys/girls would buy me a pizza from pizza hut or dominos today being the only places in the area. Im tired of ramen and processed ham. I understand many people have less but today I'd like to eat and be satisfied for the first time in a while. When Im in position to return the favor to random acts of pizza I surely will. Just today I'd like a break. Also, if it interests you I'm entering a program to get my associates degree in welding for two years where I will be living and getting an allowance to learn and pull myself from a negative environment. So contributing back wont take long. Thank you redditers.
