Not to be cliche, but I'm a broke, last-year college student trying to get through the night. I would be more than willing to pay it back/forward after I get my check next week from my job. School starts tomorrow and I will have meal plans, so no worries for the rest of the semester. Feel free to check my account, it's over three years old and I participated in Secret Santa and Arbitrary Day if that gives any credibility to my intent in hitting someone back. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this.
