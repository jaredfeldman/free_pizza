My friend has a foot condition that he was born with. He was operated on one of his feet last year, and they just finished the other one yesterday! He needs to go through a recovery period of two weeks before he can start walking again, and I'd like to brighten up his day with a pizza because I can't visit him today (when two of my other friends are going).

He's not in any real need, but I think it'd be a nice thing to do since he's just an all-around great guy and taking this like a champ (and always willing to offer us food!)
