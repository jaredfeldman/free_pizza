So, I [wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lsqto/i_would_like_to_take_a_moment_to_rant_about/) a week or so ago about the problems I was having getting the student finance company to get my loan to me, and it still hasn't been resolved and I've reached the end of my overdraft (they'll only give me a £200 overdraft until my loan comes through). I tried to go to my university to get some emergency funds and the lady I spoke to said I could only get a £50 bridging loan which seeing as I'd have to pay back in 4 weeks she didn't want to give me. And after arguing with her for quite a while about how I needed the money to buy food she said that it didn't matter because the lady who could've given me the money left at 2pm (I went in at 1:30pm, she was just arguing with me for that long). 

I then went into my bank to try and get my overdraft extended and they told me I needed to do it over the phone, went home and called them up and apparently I needed to go back to my branch and do it. And it would be shut by the time I went in again today.... 

So could anyone possibly send me a pizza or like... any other food? I haven't eaten all day :(
