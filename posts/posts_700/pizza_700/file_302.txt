Hey there Reddit. Things haven't been going right for the next few days. My [roommate and best friend](http://imgur.com/ALJUP) started having suicidal thoughts a few days ago, and ended up checking herself into the ER for observation. I've just paid off rent, two weeks late, and have no money until Thursday. And my younger sister came over today because she keeps getting sick at her apartment, which means there's two mouths to feed and not much food to go around.

I'm lonely, sad, and worn down and I'm hoping that some pizza and silly tv shows might turn that around. Thing is, there's no pizza currently. If anyone is willing to donate some I would be insanely grateful. 

Thanks in advance.
