So i've been surviving off bread and soup for a few days and have a few more days of that to look forward to. I don't get off work for a few hours though and all my soup is at home. I only have 3 cans left, so I'm hesitant to even eat them.


Would anyone be able to hook up a pizza? Any pizza? I had some M&amp;M's today but even making this request is making me salivate.

Update: In another thread Krayer saw and sent me $7.92 so imma go buy some tuna and cup of noodles. Thank you to anyone who read this post but tonight, I dine on canned fish!

Edit 2: 1369ic hooked it up a lil more so when possible i shall post a picture of my tuna, bread, and other good eats in place of pizza tonight.
