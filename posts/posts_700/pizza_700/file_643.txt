I've been eating coffee grinds for the past few days. I'm out of town working, about 600km away, until Thursday when I get paid. I would have been fine but I loaned a few thousand dollars to my parents and they couldn't pay me back when I had to go back to school for a few weeks. I spent the last of my money on medication and now I have 51 cents in the bank, luckily some bills bounced instead of overdrafting my account.

I don't know, if no one else needs help I would be grateful.
