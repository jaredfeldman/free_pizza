I've loved RAOP for a very long time and always wanted to participate and give someone pizza, but never had the chance.  Now that I'm in a time of need I feel like RAOP will be there for me.  
I haven't eaten for two days and only slept about 20 hours this week due to working on installations.  

**However!**

I was just commissioned for two pieces and will be paid within the month!  So for the person who does help me out tonight, I will buy you or a person of your choosing pizza once I get paid.  
Thank you in advance!  This is honestly one of the best communities on Reddit.
