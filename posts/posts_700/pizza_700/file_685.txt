After spending 18 hours in a lot of pain and devoid of any appetite, the pain has either taken a break or I am stone free. Either way I am exhausted and (finally!) starving. Not really wanting to move around much for fear of jinxing the peace my ureter has found and pizza sounds delicious. Anyone want to help a girl out? Your act would never be forgotten by me and always appreciated.
