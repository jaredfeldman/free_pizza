I'm a college student and I've run out of money, I have very little food for the rest of the semester and I rationing it so it will last (it's mostly oatmeal). I eat just enough to keep me going. I wish i had ramen and Mac n' Cheese, otherwise I wouldn't be asking for pizza.  Thanks for hearing me out reddit.
