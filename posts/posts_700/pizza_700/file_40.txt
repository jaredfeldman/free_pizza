Hey all, I am in a real rough patch. Hopefully for only another week or two. Basically my story is I was laid off a month and a half ago. I had a little bit of cash and my unemployment so everything was looking not great but at least ok. Well an employer from last fall is contesting the fact that they should have to contribute to my unemployment. I had the phone hearing, I know I am in the right, I got a w2 from them with taxes taken out. But until the final call is made, my unemployment checks are being withheld. It has been 2 weeks now, well 3 unemployment checks. I have been steadily looking for work. My phone got shut off the other day and I had to use $80 of my last $100 to pay it so I can receive phone interviews. 

I bought some ramen and have been eating it for most of my meals for the past week now, my Thanksgiving dinner looks like more of the same.  I would really like some protein, something tasty and feel full again after a meal.

I live in Chicago, IL which has a million and a half great pizza joints but I am by no means picky, just hungry. Could anyone help a guy out? Once I find a job and back on my feet I would be more than happy to "pizza it forward" or pay you back. Thanks reddit.
