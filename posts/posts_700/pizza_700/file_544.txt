Single Mom here. So, my oldest is almost 9. She came down with strep three days after school started back. Yay. =\ Had a semi stressful weekend with trying to keep her and my youngest (almost 11 months) apart so the youngest wouldn't get infected too. However, the baby woke me up at 2am yesterday morning with a faucet for a nose and a slight cough. Called the doctor to see if that warranted a visit, and low and behold it does. She was also positive for strep. She's a really good baby though, and except for being off her bottle (I guess the sucking hurts?) a little bit, and hating to have her nose wiped, she's dealing amazingly well. 

So to sum it up, I've got two sick kids and I'm behind on household chores (anyone got a laundry fairy they can spare??) and I'd really just like a night off from cooking dinner. I'm not desperate for food, and I totally understand if there are others who are and you'd rather help them. 

We're in Metro Atlanta, and are happy with any of the three major chains, but we also have Hungry Howies and Bucks pizza who both have online ordering. My oldest only eats cheese, and I'll take any meat product on the other side. Allergies to mushrooms, so please none of those. :) 

I hope that's enough info.. but if not, feel free to ask me anything. :)
