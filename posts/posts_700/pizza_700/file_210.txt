Hello fellow redditors,

I lost my job earlier this month, and my pockets are near empty. I'm fortunate to have landed a decent job, but my stomach is grumbling and I'm almost out of bread. It isn't a completely desperate situation, but if anyone is willing to help me out I couldn't thank them enough. I could send you a small painting or sculpture when I'm able to cover shipping and all that, if that interests you.

Thanks for reading
