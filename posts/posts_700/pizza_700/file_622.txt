It's a big deal to ask for this, as I'm the first to admit that I am very independent and hate asking for help, but I've got nowhere else to turn. 

Story: I'm a freelance theater artist, and I depend upon a steady stream of checks from my various performing and teaching gigs to stay afloat. However, this week two theaters where I teach failed to send my payment, and while I've worked it out to have those missed payments added in a few weeks, I'm currently down to $10 to last me for food for the next two weeks! I am almost out of food at my house, and I've finally accepted that I can't just tough it out with no food for two weeks... so I'm turning to you, the Reddit community, for help!

If you are able to help, I would be extremely grateful! Thank you for reading!


EDIT: I accidentally a sentence.
