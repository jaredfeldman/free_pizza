Hello! Normally we would never do this, but we (me and my girlfriend) were hoping someone might be nice enough to buy us a pizza tonight? 

Normally we wouldn't be in such hard shape, but delays in receiving my paycheck and some crazy insane overdraft fees (THANKS TCF!) have left us with a grand total of $2.50 between the two of us until Sunday.

We promise to pay it forward to another needing person next week when we are finally in the black again. I can send you proof of that if you would like. I used a throw-away for this post, but I would have no problem verifying my identity to anyone gracious enough to help. 

So, if you might be interested in helping us out let me know. We will be browsing /r/aww in the mean time, keeping a smile on our face and positive attitude on this whole situation. Thanks!
