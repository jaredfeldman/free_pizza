I'm looking to get some pizza for my day off. I posted to /r/loans first, cause I would like to either pay the person back or pay it forward. I don't get paid until the weekend, so that's when I will be paying it back/forward.
 
I worked two 12 hour shifts back to back and I'm looking for some pizza to relax with. Thanks in advance if you can help :D

Edit: 1 day later, could still use some pizza. Sure hope I get paid today :s
