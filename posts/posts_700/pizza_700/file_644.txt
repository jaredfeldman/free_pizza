And I just ate the last two eggs in my APT and now only have a can of chicken noodle soup,some potato wedges,minute rice and half a loaf of bread in my kitchen. I've been working my ass off for the past month but recently had to put 900 bucks into my car two weeks before my rent was due. After paying rent on the 1st I had 35 bucks to last me 10 days until pay day. I am now down to 7 bucks and I work Tomorrow, Thursday and Friday. I have just over qtr of a tank left and my work is 12 miles from my apt, so I'm pretty much spending that 7 bucks on gas in hopes that it will get me enough to get to work. I have gotten pizzas on here before, and i've been lurking thru the threads this week trying to win a pizza but every time i'm to late. I know that RAOP gets these type of sob stories all day, and a lot of them arent rewarded so i'm not really putting to much hope into this. I just thought it would be nice to try and get a large pizza that I could munch on for a few days so I dont starve before pay day.
