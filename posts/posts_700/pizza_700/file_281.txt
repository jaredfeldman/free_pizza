Hi RAoP

As the title suggests, I have been doing it tough over the last few months.  I am knee deep in debt from being screwed by my partner while trying to start a business.  My current job pays monthly and I am a few days out from being paid but due to some unforeseen vet bills this month, I have found myself without much money or food for the last 2 weeks.  
Tonight, I will be having another meal of rice and peas, which I have been surviving on since my cats incident (she is fine now, thankfully) and I am dieing for something nice for a Sunday night.  If there is a kind internet stranger out there who feels like helping someone who has been going through a rough time over the last few months, it would make my entire year!  When I get paid I'll be happy to come visit again to pass the karma on to someone else who needs it. 
I live in Australia, if that makes a difference.
