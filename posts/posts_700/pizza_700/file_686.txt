I thought I had planned a bit better for my family, but I wasn't able to stretch this last check as far. The wife and I have been fighting to pay medical bills with no end in sight. My wife has been in remission from cancer for 3 months. We're both staying hopeful that she have defeated this. I don't know what I would do if I lost my wife. She has been the love of my life for 15 years and we are still going strong. I feel that I've let her down as a man because we have never gone without food. This is probably one of the lowest moments of my life, but I have to ask for help. I asked my brother if he could loan me a little cash until Friday but he's in just as bad of a situation as I am. I found a food pantry but it's too far away and no one at this location was willing to meet me halfway. I am hoping that someone out there can help my family and I. Please consider us. Thank you.
