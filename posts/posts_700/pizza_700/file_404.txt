Hey gents and ladies,

I am a very poor college student that has to work to pay for school, rent, and food because the rents refuse to help. Because I came down with the flu for a week and a half, I couldn't go in to work (its policy) and thus only have money for rent. I've been subsisting just about entirely on PB&amp;J sammiches. I just finished biking home from work, and would really appreciate a nice warm pizza tonight.
 
Ps-I am using a throwaway because my main is linked to several close friends that are also redditors, and I don't want them to know of my financial situation. 
You guys are fantastic, and if anyone does respond, please know that you will make a poor UF girl really happy! &lt;3 :D

**Edit: it appears my title lost my location. I'm in Florida. :)
