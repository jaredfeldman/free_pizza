The kids I watch got signed up for summer camp last minute, so all of my working hours are gone. I'm waiting at home now for a few phone calls about jobs, but it's not looking great for being able to eat much more than rice and beans or pasta until the 15th, so a pizza sounds super fantastic, especially after seeing [this](http://redd.it/1fc8e4). It's my first post here, sorry if anything is amiss, thanks for reading!
