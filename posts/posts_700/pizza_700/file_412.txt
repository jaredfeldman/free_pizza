I'm in the Hyde Park area and would love some pizza, and would especially love seeing some more "random" acts dished out!  If pizza'ed, I promise, in the nature of being similarly random and kind, of gifting a a pizza tomorrow evening to another random requesting individual who intends to pay it forward the next day.  Want to join me in breathing more random life into this sub?  Let's make some human connections that don't end with the next person.

Additionally, if this works, I think we could generate a lot more interest, and a lot more giving, by earmarking a pay-it-forward trend as [PIF] included in the title.  More activity in general means more pizza for everyone, including [PIF]s and those who could really just use a pizza and are unsure if they can return the gift in the near future.  Here's to the random and flourishing future of RAoP!
