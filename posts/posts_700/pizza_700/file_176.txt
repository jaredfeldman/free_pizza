I am requesting a pizza for dinner. My hubby is in the ICU unit,.He had a sezuier and hit his head. They had to do emergency Brain surgery, He is medical coma. Its to early to tell what is going to happen to him. If you cant do a pizza, Please sent good thoughts his way .

Why am I on the internet? I am trying to keep my mind busy, Thanks :]
