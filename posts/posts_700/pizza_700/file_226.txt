My girlfriend and I will be broke for the next few weeks. She has a ticket to pay off, and I have to pay 1200 dollars to have my cars engine fixed (I blew 2 cylinders). After paying for this, we're essentially broke until out next payday. Just asking for a pizza for dinner tonight.Anything would be greatly appreciated.
