(*throwaway acct*)
I never thought I'd get to this point, I am selling my ps3 on craigslist and I just ran out of cereal (I have been living on dry cereal+water for the past week).  I can't eat until I get paid on the 15th, I just eat popcorn at work to fill my stomach.  It's really sad but you have to do what you have to do.  (I could make a large pizza last a week for sure).  When I get paid I WILL pay it forward, I always keep my promises.

I have a verification code and even a link to my craigslist post (still not answered after having posted it before the 1st of May).  I can take a pic of my ridiculously empty fridge/pantry, bank account is pitiful right now.

Can someone help me? Thanks so much!
