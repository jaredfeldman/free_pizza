I'll spare the juicy personal details, but I lost a group of friends and a boyfriend because someone thought it would be fun to tell them all horrible, ridiculous lies about me. I really liked all of them, and took a huge risk trusting these people because I thought they were Good People. (I'm a child abuse survivor, so I have a real hard time opening up.) I also put in a lot of energy (made gifts, gave encouragement, helped calm down anxiety attacks...)

The good news is, if they're that quick to turn on me based on someone's false information, I don't want them in my life anyway. They never asked me if it was true, just took it as fact. That's not a "friend" in my book.

The bad news is, it obviously hurts really, really bad. I'm doing the best I can to not fall apart. It's really hard to stop thinking about everything that happened. I feel like I stepped on a landmine, everything blew up in my face. I really want to watch a movie and eat some pizza and forget about all this drama for a bit. (I'm broke, so anything not eaten tonight will help sustain me until payday!) 

A gesture of kindness in the form of a pizza or even an inspiring message would mean SO much to me right now.

On a side note, pizza or no pizza, this subreddit is a great reminder that there are still kind people in the world.
