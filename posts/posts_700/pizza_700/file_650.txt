My fiancee and I have been spending all day organizing my father's house after he passed away a few weeks ago.  It's been a lot harder than I thought it would be.

We only have $2.27 in our bank account until I get paid on Tuesday, and it would be really nice to not have to heat up ANOTHER Cup O' Noodles tonight, and instead be able to relax and chow down on some deliciousness.
