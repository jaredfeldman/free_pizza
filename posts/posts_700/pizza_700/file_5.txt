Starving writer, here

located in Savannah

just recently moved;

*


Myself and husband

both working but no money

nothing in the fridge.

*

We have much love, still

it's hard to eat out your heart

or something like that.

*

If you pizza me

I will thank you in haiku

customized for you

*

And, when things improve

I will pay it forward, too:

Zen pizza haiku!
