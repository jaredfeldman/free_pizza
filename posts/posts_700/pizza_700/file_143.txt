Hi guys, never done this before so I don't know if it will work or not but worth a shot is it not? Basically the situation is as follows.. I am in Wellington, New Zealand. I am hungover because last night I was out in town drinking and watching the warriors lose to manly in the NRL grand final :( used up most of my spare money taxing home and now I am looking at a fairly empty fridge/pantry.. My car is 30 mins walk away and it is PISSING down with rain which I don't really wanna brave to go to the super market.

Pretty much wondering if a kickass random stranger would hook me up with a pizza to cure my hangover and cheer me up after yesterdays loss. Will be sure to pay it on in the future to another needy individual.

Thankyou THR - you are the greatest!
