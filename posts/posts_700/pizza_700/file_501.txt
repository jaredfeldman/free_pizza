The lease for our apt is up here in the next week, and we will be moving back to the Midwest, but the cupboards are bare as our checks have gone entirely to bills / moving expenses (shipping your life is $$). Would love to have something besides the leftover ramen in the fridge to go with the night of cleaning ahead of us in the empty apt. We will pay it forward!
