How has my week been? Well I got paid on Thursday and after paying the mortgage and unexpected meds I have about $15-20 to last me the next 2 weeks after it all clears the bank.

So I am sitting here at work dreading going home to another bowl of ramen or a PB&amp;J. And while I don't really NEED a pizza tonight it would be nice.

I'm in West Texas btw.
