Hey RAoP, first time post, I'm feeling desperate. 
Money is really tight with me these past few months because I just moved to a new apartment just south of Bellevue. Which has managed to milk me dry with its first months rent and deposit, came out to about 1100 bucks. 
(barely make 1k a month)
I am, as a result, flat broke, and also haven't been able to eat for about 36 hours. My next paycheck also wont be here until next wednesday Dec, 6.
If any good people are willing to spring for a pizza which would last me a few days, I would be entirely grateful!
