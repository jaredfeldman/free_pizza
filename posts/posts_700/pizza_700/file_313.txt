I've got some staples in the house, Ramen, PB &amp; J, and a beanie weenie casserole and I will be going to the food pantry on Monday (I get paid on Thrusday) But I would totally dig a pizza tonight. (Maybe a soda as well?) 

There is only so much ramen you can eat before you start to lose your mind. I know everyone post I'll pay it forward when I get paid, but I WILL pay it forward on Thrusday. :)
