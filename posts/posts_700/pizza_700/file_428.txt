So I'm one of those American working poor, my paycheck on friday all went toward rent (which I was behind on, didn't want to be on the streets) and other bills such as power (my state has some of the highest power charges on the west coast, so it's not cheap no matter how much you conserve). Anyway, I had enough left over to buy a few packs of ramen which is ran out pretty fast. I went to my local food bank after work (not above getting help there), however they closed at 3 today (normally they close at 5). I'm going tomorrow after work but am very hungry. Sorry for the long post but if anyone is willing to give I'd be grateful. I'd be willing to provide any proof I can give. Cheers
