[request] SAP in [California] comes to you in her time of pizza need.

So I am more of a lurker and I know it makes me look bad but I have been here nearly three years and I hope that gives me some credit. (I am great at run-on sentences). 

My little family of two and one cat would love to indulge in a pizza. We have been going through some tough times recently. We just paid the rent and now have 24$ to our name. We are going to do whatever we can to have it hold us over until Wednesday. A pizza is not a necessity but it would be a real treat. 

In exchange I can offer pictures of my adorable cat Charlie (he has plenty of food so there are no worries there) and a promise to pay it forward as soon as I can. 

Thank you Random_Acts_Of_Pizza!
