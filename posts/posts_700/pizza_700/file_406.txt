Hi guys, if you've clicked in this post and you're reading this, then thank you for at least considering my plight.

I'm just looking for a morsel to eat is all. I didn't eat all day today (United Kingdom, Tuesday), and I won't eat all day tomorrow (Wednesday) until I get my housing benefit on Thursday, which is meant to pay my rent but doesn't even cover that and I will now have to do food shopping with.

I have 7 pence in my bank account currently I believe. I would really, *really* appreciate it if some one could make it so I didn't have to go two days plain hungry.

Thanks for your reading, and thanks for your time and consideration. I only ever wanted to get by. Let me know if you're interested in helping. 

Thanks.
