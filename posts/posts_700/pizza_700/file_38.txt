Let me start by saying that this site is incredible.  First of all, it's encouraging to see so many wonderful people out there helping each other.  That's just magical.  The other side of that is while I'm not glad to know there are others going through what I'm going through, I am glad to know that I'm not alone.  I think that's probably the hardest part sometimes.  You look around and you see everyone else, and no one lets on that anything is wrong.  Some people make life look so easy.  I haven't know easy in a long time.  There's a Sheryl Crow song that goes, "No one said it would be easy, but no one said it'd be this hard."  I hear that in my head a lot.  I'm not looking for easy, I just wish every minute wasn't such a struggle.  

I will say this though.  Today has been an amazing day.  I came on here looking for help, and have found myself being able to help others.  I can't tell you how great that has made me feel today.  This is a feeling that everyone should know.  

My husband died a little over a year ago.  I have been working three jobs to try and support our two kids who are 3 and 4.  In January I went back to school to pursue a degree in nursing so that I could have a steady future.  I can not tell you how intimidating it is being back in school all these years later and being a mom on top of that.  It's going well though, and I'm excited for the future.  

We are barely making it each month, but we find a way.  My daughter is going to turn 4 in two weeks, and I'm having a small party for her at our home.  It has a modest budget, and I've been coming up with what will hopefully be fun cheap activities for the party.  What I'm hoping is to make it a pizza party.  It's just something that the way the bills fall and the money comes in that I'm not in a position to really splurge on.  
I'm praying for some help and appreciate anyone who stopped to even read this.

Thank you.
