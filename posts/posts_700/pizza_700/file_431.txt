Hello. I've never posted in Random Acts of Pizza before, so I apologize if I'm not doing this correctly.

I'd love to surprise my wife with a pizza tonight if I could.  She worked from 4pm to 1am on Monday, and Tuesday. She then went back to work this morning (Wednesday) from 9am to 5pm. 
Money is pretty tight in our household right now, and she has my debit card so I cannot surprise her myself. But she has been working really hard lately. I've very proud of her, and I want to see her rewarded for her efforts.

I work a "normal" 8-5, M-F job. So this will be the first time since Sunday we'll be at home together while not being unconscious. I hope this works out!

( I don't know if any of the stuff below matters, I'm just trying to be thorough.)


We live in a college town, so there is a Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's, and Papa Murphy's.
No olives or peppers please. (She hates the first, and the second gives me acid reflux.)
