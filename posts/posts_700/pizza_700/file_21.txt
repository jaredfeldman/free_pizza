**Warning:** *This may be cheesy.*
   
I would sure love a pizza  
the problem is, I'm broke  
I would use 420 as a reason  
but I cant, cause I don't toke  

my mouth is a' watering  
just typing this freakin poem  
sauce and cheese and cheese and sauce  
and Mountain Dew a flowin'  

oh how I could only hope  
to burn my lips tonight  
on a steaming melty greasy peice  
of a glorious pizza pie  

Im not here to look for pity  
but on this poem I must amend  
I felt like a baller on last friday  
but Im counting change this weekend  

The food in the fridge is old and moldy  
even though once it was hoarded wealth  
I would clean it out but I cant  
'cause it would be hazardous to my health  

basically what Im saying is  
I love pizza more than life  
and I would LOVE to take you guys up  
if someone's a' offerin' a slice  

*Seriously though, you guys are awesome. I love Reddit.*
