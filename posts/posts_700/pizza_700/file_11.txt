EDIT- Fulfilled! Awesomely!

I'm a poor about-to-be-a-premed-student-starting-tomorrow. This is terrifying. Pizza (and maybe a salad, so I don't feel godawful fat. Just a pizza is dandy too) would help calm my nerves. Alas, I have no spare money. So, I am proposing a magnificent trade- I will finish the scarf that I just learned to crochet on (which will be finished in three or four more days), and a drawing of a narwhal, for pizza. Or a penguin, or an abrictosaurus, should you want the picture sent off NOW, because I already have drawings of those. Both are pretty awesome.

(I'm gonna finish the scarf in a lobelia blue, then black, and then maybe repeat a color or two to get it up to 5 feet long. Right now it's just about exactly two feet. Full disclosure, I did learn to crochet right before I started it, so the beginning isn't great. If you're willing to wait a week or two, I can make a new one from scratch that will all be nice. In that case, your options for colors are hunter green, pale blue-gray, a deep slightly reddish purple, lobelia blue, silver gray, and black. I can do stripes, and will do zig-zags but they aren't perfect. Stripes are way better. Anyway. Those are your options. I could totally do a bitchin' Slytherin-esque scarf (no coat of arms), or a black/silver/gray one, or... your options are endless)
