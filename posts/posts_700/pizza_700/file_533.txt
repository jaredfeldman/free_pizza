She insists on cooking for our family every night because she thinks it's her job. She's been working a lot of overtime though lately and I just wish I could surprise her and our family with a pizza to start off her well deserved week end.  Found a deal at pizzahut for a 5.55 one topping large, and tried to round up change, but fell well short.
