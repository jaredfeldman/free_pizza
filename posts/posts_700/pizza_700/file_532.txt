i've been out of work do to a broken wrist for the last couple months. money is really tight, as i don't qualify for shortterm disability. my live-in girlfriend is super supportive, but we are both really stressed out due to finances. 

we haven't eaten out in months, and her favorite food is pizza. she has had to do most of the cooking and cleaning since my injury (hard as hell to scrub pots with one hand). i have spent all day cleaning the house, but to really make her evening, i'd like for her to have pizza.
