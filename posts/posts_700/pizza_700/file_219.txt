I'm just having the greatest of days. My phone's been shut off due to lack of payment, I ran out of gas on the way home from work today, been working for the last 6 days and I still don't get paid until Friday. Looking at the last two bricks of ramen that I have left makes my heart sink. Could anyone make my heart soar again? I would be willing to pay forward a pie after pay day 7/1/11
