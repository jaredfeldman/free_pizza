Hey r/Random_acts_of_pizza, I don't normally ask for this sort of thing, but money is super tight right now, and we're down to our last pound of hamburger. Me and my girlfriend won't have a chance to get food again until the 5th, and after hamburger based food for the past week or so, we're sick of it.

So what I'm putting up on the table is, my girlfriend is an excellent artist. She mostly does anime, and stuff, but she's amazing at what she does. 

For proof, [Picture 1](http://i.imgur.com/QvLL5.jpg), [Picture 2, WIP](http://i.imgur.com/mPF5B.jpg)

If you'd like to buy us a medium pie, She will gladly do a piece of art for you, anything you want.(Minus "Mecha") :D

Thanks for browsing, and I hope you have a wonderful day!

**EDIT: Oopsies! We're in Murfreesboro, TN. :D**
