OK so here goes my story. I'm an apprentice glassblower and computer guy. Last weekend my fridge died spoiling all of the groceries I had for the week and I literally haven't eaten anything since Monday morning.  My bank account is overdrawn by 40 dollars, have no cash to my name and will not be paid until Friday. I make glass pendants and marbles and will gladly trade someone glasswork next week for a pizza today. 

Edit: Can provide screenshot of overdrawn bank account as proof if requested.
