EDIT: There was a change of plans and I am leaving tonight, so I no longer need a pizza. I'll just eat when I get home.


I posted yesterday under r/randomactsofpizza yesterday because I didn't know about this one before hand

I'm over in Port Orchard, WA dog sitting for some people, and I was under the impression they were going to leave me some food to eat. They aren't coming back until very late tonight and until then I don't have many options until they pay me.

What I can offer is a picture of me, the dog, and the pizza as soon as I get home on Tuesday.

A pepperoni pizza would be a great lunch and dinner for me, and I would really appreciate one. Danke danke sehr.
