My name is Liz. I'm 22 and stuck in my food barren apartment with nothing but an empty wallet and a frown. I would sincerely appreciate any help in filling my tummy with some cheesy goodness. I wish I had a sad story to tell but to be honest I was at the Philadelphia Folk Festival for the weekend and stupidly spent all my money, forgetting that my cabinets were empty back at home. Now I'm sitting here, tummy grumblin, on the verge of a headache, hoping to God that someone will show me alittle empathy. Thank you for your time and good day.

EDIT: around the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area.
