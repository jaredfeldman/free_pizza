I posted a request already but basically, I have some food here at home but can't afford to go buy anything and my boyfriend and his girls and I are all craving pizza quite a bit. 

(I can provide proof if need be)

Thought I would give this a try and and hopefully recieve a pizza! I solemnly swear to offer pizza in a couple weeks :) 

Thanks!
