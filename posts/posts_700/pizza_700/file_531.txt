So pretty much your average run of the mill request. Me and my GF split up about a week ago, she is leaving and I am stuck with a lease I can't afford on my own, and have spent all my money paying for bills and gas to get to work. I don't get paid tell Friday and I have eaten through all the left over roman in the house. Could use a pizza to cheer me up and eat on for a few days. I'm not usually a requester and I am not horribly hard up, so if there is someone more deserving please choose them over me. Thanks for considering my request and happy pizza giving and what not.
