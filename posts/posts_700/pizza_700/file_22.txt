Hey RAOP! I am currently unemployed and just graduate from Missouri State with a degree in journalism. Life's been hard recently and I only have 60 bucks to spend over the next 2 1/2 weeks. My food stamps ran out and I cannot get back on the for another 3 weeks. 

I would love a pizza, because as of late, I have been eating one package of Ramen a day. I am about to go to the store to get my dog some more food, and probably will only have 45 dollars left after that. 

My parents are in a similar situation and really cannot help me. I have never been in such a poor situation my entire life, and some pizza would definitely make my situation a lot more tolerable! 

Thanks!
