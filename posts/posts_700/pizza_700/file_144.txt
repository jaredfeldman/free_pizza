Made a throw away because I don't want my friends or family to know I'm short on cash atm. I hate asking for things, especially to my friends and family so I made this throw away to ask reddit instead. I am willing to provide my main account which is over a year old, requested once before but I also gave a pie in return as well.

Atm bit broke while waiting for work since school just finished and was hoping for a pizza. I of course plan to either return the favor to the person who sends it or will be posting up another offer in the next few days when my payment is confirmed from paypal and I have cash again while searching for work.
