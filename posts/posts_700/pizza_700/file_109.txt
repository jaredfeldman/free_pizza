~~Reddit has given me a lot lately, and I am very thankful. So if you are going to choose between me and someone that needs it more, go with someone else. I have a 6 person family - me, husband, and kids 10, 5, 4, and turning 2 next month - and with me having to buy the parts for a new computer (I make my living online) and trying to buy xmas presents, we aren't going to be able to eat anything that isn't homemade for awhile. I normally make pizza myself, but we're out of cheese. My 4 year old has asked me every morning for the past 3 days if we can have pizza for dinner...~~

Someone that wishes to remain anonymous sent me some pizza. Thanks so much!!
