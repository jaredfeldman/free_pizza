I've been pretty discouraged this week in terms of finding employment, monetary problems, health issue and so on. I'm a bit too self conscious to really dig into it but if you need proof of my lack-of-funds, I'd be more than willing to provide that for you.

In this request, I hope for more than pizza but the kindness of a stranger to help me lift my spirits during my time of need by filling an empty belly. This is a hard time in my life but I'm hoping this request will help things turn around! :)
