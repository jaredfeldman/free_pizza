So The next quarter of school starts monday, and I get my next financial aid check on tuesday. My bank account however is at 1.83. Im not starving, but whats left in my house till tuesday is PB&amp;J, top ramen, bagged salad and brown rice. A pizza would really break up the monotony of what ive been eating since about sunday. If this request is answered, however much a person would gift me I will pay forward with interest to someone when my check goes in next week. Thank you for your time.
