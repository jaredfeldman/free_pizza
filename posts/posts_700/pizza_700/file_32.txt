I'll spare you my sob story. Pizza would be indescribably awesome! This is my first time asking and I'll definitely pay it forward.

edit: F5, don't fail me now! If you can beat the crap out of the Reddit alien, surely you can help  make some pizza magic!

edit2: I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more just to *be* the man whose pizza gets delivered to his door.

edit3: Mediocre, random, boredom and hunger-inspired fact: one of my highest scoring posts ever was a video on how to fold a fitted sheet.

edit4: I used to be a delivery guy. Cheesesteaks. On a very regular basis, customers would take several minutes to answer the door, yelling "HOLD ON!!!" open it, huffing and puffing, sweat rolling down their faces and half naked bodies. They were usually about as attractive as you'd imagine chronic cheesesteak takeout-orderers would be.
