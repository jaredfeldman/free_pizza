My brother told me about this site a while ago. After looking at other entries, I'm blown away. I hope someone can extend their Random Acts of Pizza Kindness to my family and me.
I don't want to make anyone sad, but the side says to be honest. My wife was killed in a car accident a year ago last week. She was an amazing mother and wife. Readjusting has been really hard, but our kids are tough and are working through it. I have an amazing support system, but sometimes things just don't add up. My parents and her dad are incredible and do so much for us, but I hate asking them for help. They already do so much and it's really embarrassing not being able to give my kids something as small as pizza. Normally we do a "pizza" night once a month, but with school just starting, I'm coming up short. I hate asking for help, but it seems like a really open and friendly environment, so I'd like to try. I can't wait to pay it back next month. I'm thinking the kids can pick a contest and the winner. Thanking you from the bottom of my heart. Jim
