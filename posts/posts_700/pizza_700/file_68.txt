Hey guys, this is my first time posting on here. I've been following this subreddit for a while, and asking for a pizza never really came to mind. Well my birthday is today, and normally I take myself somewhere to celebrate, but after recently paying my college tuition, I was left with [a little over a dollar](http://i.imgur.com/bnKd2.png) in my account. I'd really appreciate a RAOP. 

Thanks :)
