Hey guys, I just paid my rent here in Richmond. I have maybe 2 to 3 dollars left in my account? I haven't had a nice hot pepperoni pizza in awhile (besides those cheap mini frozen ones)! Also, just found out this morning that our Internet cut out because of the wiring in our building? But I still had to pay the bill for that last week despite complains of no service. Anyway, just looking for some kindness of random pizza!
