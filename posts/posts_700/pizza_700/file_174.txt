Hello RAoP!

My fianc√© and I have been living on cereal, grilled cheese sandwiches and jello for almost 2 week now. Our [fridge](http://imgur.com/pXp9j) is bare aside from the essentials (milk, cheese, bread) and will remain that way until the 3rd. I'm okay with eating this way for a couple more days but my guy is going crazy. He just went off to work with a sack lunch of the usual and made a comment about how his stomach is shrinking and it made me feel bad. I was thinking about a hot meal I can make (for us for when he got home) with what we have but there's not much. Plus, I have a fussy baby on my hands. We have an 8 month old who is a high risk infant so she gets a monthly RSV shot to prevent her from getting the nasty virus. She's been a handful since yesterday :(

I've never requested a pizza here before and we aren't really the types to splurge on eating takeout. But if I had the money I'd do it today, as it would raise our spirits. I just got my verification code so if anyone can hook it up I would greatly appreciate it! I would also pay it forward as soon as I'd be able to :)

Thanks &lt;3
