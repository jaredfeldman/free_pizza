Hi, I'm Hungry. (joke here) I would love a pizza of some kind. I live in Shreveport LA so the pizza joints are Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Johnny's pizza (Local chain)

I don't have the money to afford a pizza nor any meals for the next 2 weeks. I won't starve or anything. I have plenty of rice and soup. I just want a real meal.

I don't have much to offer but I have a website cazes.tumblr.com and I make crazy art thingies. I'll make you some if you can gift me with pizza. 

I would be eternally grateful for anything you could provide. 

Love,
drcazes
