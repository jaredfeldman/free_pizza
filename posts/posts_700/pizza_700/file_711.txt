EDIT: CayucosKid was kind enough to buy me a couple pizzas, they just showed up and not only taste amazing, but will feed me for the rest of the weekend. Thank you so much.

So, my roommate had told me about this Reddit, and I had planned to keep it in mind to give other people pizza every once in a while. I wasn't planning on using this for me...but I'm in a really tough situation right now. 
A little background: I had to take a hardship withdrawal last spring and drop out of college when I lost my dining hall job. I managed to get a new job at a call center in town that is "always hiring" and that's been pretty decent, but not quite enough to pay the bills and pay for food. I've been surviving off the kindness of my landlord/roommates, (I do dishes I don't have to pay for food) but that can only go so far. I'm attempting to go back to school so I don't have to pay my student loans back, especially since the call volume is dropping at the center and I haven't been getting the best hours. 
According to the government I make too much money to qualify for food stamps, and my dad makes too much money for me to qualify for Pell Grant. My car has been spazzing out and I think it's probably on it's last legs, and today I didn't even make conversion at work for the month, so I don't get any bonuses.
Overall everything's just been a bit rough, I definitely plan on paying it forward as soon as I get everything together. One of my landlords wants me to dogsit for a couple weeks or so next month, and I'll be able to cover everything then.
It's just been a really rough day and I could use a meal that I didn't have to cook myself today.
