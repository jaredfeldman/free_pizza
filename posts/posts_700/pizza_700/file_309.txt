I had my hours cut at work from 40 to 24 a week. For this reason I am very broke right now, and going to move back in with my father in two weeks. I only have $4, and being Gluten Free I don't have many options with that much money (No options really). If someone could send a gluten free pizza my way, I would be very thankful, and purchase one for somebody on Friday when I get paid. If you are wondering how to get a gluten free pizza, Dominos does a great job with it. Not sure if Pizza Hut or anyone else does gluten free, but I trust Dominos. Please let me know if you are able to help me out today, I could really use some food! Thanks in advance!
