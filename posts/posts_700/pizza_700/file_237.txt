lately life just seems like there's no hope in sight...at a weird point in life. i left the girl of my dreams because my mom got sick with cancer and had to return to my hometown from living with her in japan. i get home, shit's fucked up, i can't do anything, she breaks up with me. i ended up going back to school to try and get a worthwhile degree (engineering, go figure) and thus spend all my time studying. I also have to work because i come from a fairly poor family and need to pay for an apartment close to campus (not to mention there's no room for me at any of my relative's houses). all my money goes to rent and other monthlys. i don't really have a supportive family, and the friends i thought i had in my city have left because "i'm too much of a downer." really supportive of them huh? now i just have really superficial relationships with the ones that were closest to me and i hate it...yeah, making stupid jokes is fun, but real friends should be there for each other, through anything. 

tonight i'm studying for finals and i would really enjoy some decent food. i've never asked for anything like this but maybe the universe will smile upon me today? i promise to pay it forward, i know that energy flows in a circle. i am really grateful for everything i do have and i know that i'm a million times better off than 98% of the world...but still...suffering is relative to the individual, isn't it? if you can help i will be eternally grateful to you and will do anything i can for you or for another person later on.

thanks for looking
