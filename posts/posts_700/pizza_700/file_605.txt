I have to survive somehow until next Friday, when I get paid, until then I have to survive day-to-day and eat anything I can find. On my way home from work, I remembered this sub-reddit, I'll be happy to pay it forward regardless if I get helped or not. This situation has made me realize what how difficult tough situations can be.
