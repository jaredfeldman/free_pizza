So this is my first [REQUEST] thread that I've made. It's just me and my girlfriend, both poor college students, wanting a pizza. I have posted to offers before, but never received. I will definitely be a giver when it is possible for me, but right now I'm waiting on paychecks in the mail and have no means of getting pizza for us.

If anyone would like pictures of us, we'll be glad to provide. Also, if there is anything you'd like to ask me, ask away. I'm open to just about any questions.

Thanks RAoP'ers!
