Hi ROAP! I am going through a rough time right now. My fiance left me recently and going from a two income household to one hasn't been easy. Especially with debt from some credit cards and loans in my name that were used to benefit the both of us. I will be honest I am not starving to death, but I am really upset and it would really cheer me up to have something with flavor to eat. ( I have been eating mostly oats, rice, and beans ) I am willing to use the verifaction system to check my ip and email to prove I am not a scammer. Thanks!
