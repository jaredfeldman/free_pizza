Have recently moved to california and unsuccessful in finding work. as it is I'm in my small flat that turns out is really cold when you cant afford heating and haven't been able to buy anything to eat for 2 days, have been living off local jewish comunity who ocasionally are kind enough to give us some food, would love a pizza.
