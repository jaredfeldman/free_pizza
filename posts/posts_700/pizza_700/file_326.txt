I will go ahead and say that I got a pizza meal from here before as to not seem like I'm scamming anyone. I have been promised 2 well-paying jobs and one minimum wage + .40 to fill in the gaps of unemployment of a second job, if that makes sense, but I'm waiting until they call me in for that expendable job, a background check for one, and a test request for the other. I will be able to pay forward this one and the previous random act of pizza when I can get my life straight. I will pay the previous one forward whether I get food from this or not. Didn't want to sound like I'm taking that promise to pay it forward hostage. Anyway, it would benefit me, my roommate, his brother, and his mom greatly if we could get some pizza.

Edit: Not caring what trolls like francewinwars say, especially if all they do is convince people to NOT help the less-fortunate. If anyone wants to roll the dice and buy us pizza for the day, I will pay it forward as soon as I get spare cash, which should be within the next couple of months.
