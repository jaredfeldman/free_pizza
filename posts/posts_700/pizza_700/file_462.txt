I'm just being 100% honest here. I'm not starving, but due to me losing my job and only having enough money to pay bills for 2 months if I don't buy anything, I haven't had pizza in a very long time. I actually moved here from out of state because the job market is better. I am currently living with my parents, at the age of 32. :(
